<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This story is, first, for young women
to read; second, for young men to
read; after that, for anybody who
wants to. Anyone who doubts its facts and
figures is referred to "Social Diseases and
Marriage," by Dr. Prince Morrow, or to
"Hygiene and Morality," by Miss Lavinia
Dock, a trained nurse of long experience.</p>

<p>Some will hold that the painful facts disclosed
are unfit for young girls to know.
Young girls are precisely the ones who must
know them, in order that they may protect
themselves and their children to come. The
time to know of danger is before it is too
late to avoid it.</p>

<p>If some say "Innocence is the greatest
charm of young girls," the answer is, "What
good does it do them?"</p>

<p>The "Foote Girls" were bustling
along Margate Street with an air
of united purpose that was unusual
with them. Miss Rebecca wore her black
silk cloak, by which it might be seen that
"a call" was toward. Miss Jessie, the thin
sister, and Miss Sallie, the fat one, were
more hastily attired. They were persons
of less impressiveness than Miss Rebecca,
as was tacitly admitted by their more
familiar nicknames, a concession never made
by the older sister.</p>

<p>Even Miss Rebecca was hurrying a little,
for her, but the others were swifter and
more impatient.</p>

<p>"Do come on, Rebecca. Anybody'd think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
you were eighty instead of fifty!" said Miss
Sallie.</p>

<p>"There's Mrs. Williams going in! I
wonder if she's heard already. Do hurry!"
urged Miss Josie.</p>

<p>But Miss Rebecca, being concerned about
her dignity, would not allow herself to be
hustled, and the three proceeded in irregular
order under the high-arched elms and
fence-topping syringas of the small New
England town toward the austere home of
Mr. Samuel Lane.</p>

<p>It was a large, uncompromising, square,
white house, planted starkly in the close-cut
grass. It had no porch for summer lounging,
no front gate for evening dalliance, no
path-bordering beds of flowers from which
to pluck a hasty offering or more redundant
tribute. The fragrance which surrounded it
came from the back yard, or over the fences
of neighbors; the trees which waved greenly
about it were the trees of other people. Mr.
Lane had but two trees, one on each side of
the straight and narrow path, evenly placed
between house and sidewalk&mdash;evergreens.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane received them amiably; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
minister's new wife, Mrs. Williams, was
proving a little difficult to entertain. She
was from Cambridge, Mass., and emanated
a restrained consciousness of that fact. Mr.
Lane rose stiffly and greeted them. He did
not like the Foote girls, not having the usual
American's share of the sense of humor. He
had no enjoyment of the town joke, as old
as they were, that "the three of them made
a full yard;" and had frowned down as a
profane impertinent the man&mdash;a little sore
under some effect of gossip&mdash;who had
amended it with "make an 'ell, I say."</p>

<p>Safely seated in their several rocking
chairs, and severally rocking them, the
Misses Foote burst forth, as was their custom,
in simultaneous, though by no means
identical remarks.</p>

<p>"I suppose you've heard about Morton
Elder?"</p>

<p>"What do you think Mort Elder's been
doing now?"</p>

<p>"We've got bad news for poor Miss
Elder!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane was intensely interested. Even
Mr. Lane showed signs of animation.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>

<p>"I'm not surprised," he said.</p>

<p>"He's done it now," opined Miss Josie
with conviction. "I always said Rella Elder
was spoiling that boy."</p>

<p>"It's too bad&mdash;after all she's done for
him! He always was a scamp!" Thus Miss
Sallie.</p>

<p>"I've been afraid of it all along," Miss
Rebecca was saying, her voice booming
through the lighter tones of her sisters. "I
always said he'd never get through college."</p>

<p>"But who is Morton Elder, and what has
he done?" asked Mrs. Williams as soon as
she could be heard.</p>

<p>This lady now proved a most valuable
asset. She was so new to the town, and had
been so immersed in the suddenly widening
range of her unsalaried duties as "minister's
wife," that she had never even heard of
Morton Elder.</p>

<p>A new resident always fans the languishing
flame of local conversation. The whole
shopworn stock takes on a fresh lustre,
topics long trampled flat in much discussion
lift their heads anew, opinions one scarce
dared to repeat again become almost author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>itative,
old stories flourish freshly, acquiring
new detail and more vivid color.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane, seizing her opportunity while
the sisters gasped a momentary amazement
at anyone's not knowing the town scapegrace,
and taking advantage of her position
as old friend and near neighbor of the family
under discussion, swept into the field
under such headway that even the Foote
girls remained silent perforce; surcharged,
however, and holding their breaths in readiness
to burst forth at the first opening.</p>

<p>"He's the nephew&mdash;orphan nephew&mdash;of
Miss Elder&mdash;who lives right back of us&mdash;our
yards touch&mdash;we've always been friends&mdash;went
to school together, Rella's never
married&mdash;she teaches, you know&mdash;and her
brother&mdash;he owned the home&mdash;it's all hers
now, he died all of a sudden and left two
children&mdash;Morton and Susie. Mort was
about seven years old and Susie just a baby.
He's been an awful cross&mdash;but she just idolizes
him&mdash;she's spoiled him, I tell her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane had to breathe, and even the
briefest pause left her stranded to wait
another chance. The three social benefac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>tors
proceeded to distribute their information
in a clattering torrent. They sought to
inform Mrs. Williams in especial, of numberless
details of the early life and education
of their subject, matters which would
have been treated more appreciatively if
they had not been blessed with the later
news; and, at the same time, each was seeking
for a more dramatic emphasis to give
this last supply of incident with due effect.</p>

<p>No regular record is possible where three
persons pour forth statement and comment
in a rapid, tumultuous stream, interrupted
by cross currents of heated contradiction,
and further varied by the exclamations and
protests of three hearers, or at least, of two;
for the one man present soon relapsed into
disgusted silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams, turning a perplexed face
from one to the other, inwardly condemning
the darkening flood of talk, yet conscious
of a sinful pleasure in it, and anxious
as a guest, <i>and</i> a minister's wife, to be most
amiable, felt like one watching three kinetescopes
at once. She saw, in confused pictures

Elder, the young New England girl, only
eighteen, already a "school ma'am," suddenly
left with two children to bring up,
and doing it, as best she could. She saw the
boy, momentarily changing, in his shuttlecock
flight from mouth to mouth, through
pale shades of open mischief to the black
and scarlet of hinted sin, the terror of the
neighborhood, the darling of his aunt,
clever, audacious, scandalizing the quiet
town.</p>

<p>"Boys are apt to be mischievous, aren't
they?" she suggested when it was possible.</p>

<p>"He's worse than mischievous," Mr. Lane
assured her sourly. "There's a mean streak
in that family."</p>

<p>"That's on his mother's side," Mrs. Lane
hastened to add. "She was a queer girl&mdash;came
from New York."</p>

<p>The Foote girls began again, with rich
profusion of detail, their voices rising shrill,
one above the other, and playing together
at their full height like emulous fountains.</p>

<p>"We ought not to judge, you know;"
urged Mrs. Williams. "What do you say
he's really done?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>Being sifted, it appeared that this last
and most terrible performance was to go to
"the city" with a group of "the worst boys
of college," to get undeniably drunk, to do
some piece of mischief. (Here was great
licence in opinion, and in contradiction.)</p>

<p>"<i>Anyway</i> he's to be suspended!" said
Miss Rebecca with finality.</p>

<p>"Suspended!" Miss Josie's voice rose in
scorn. "<i>Expelled!</i> They said he was expelled."</p>

<p>"In disgrace!" added Miss Sallie.</p>

<p>Vivian Lane sat in the back room at the
window, studying in the lingering light of
the long June evening. At least, she appeared
to be studying. Her tall figure was
bent over her books, but the dark eyes blazed
under their delicate level brows, and her
face flushed and paled with changing feelings.</p>

<p>She had heard&mdash;who, in the same house,
could escape hearing the Misses Foote?&mdash;and
had followed the torrent of description,
hearsay, surmise and allegation with
an interest that was painful in its intensity.</p>

<p>"It's a <i>shame</i>!" she whispered under her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
breath. "A <i>shame</i>! And nobody to stand
up for him!"</p>

<p>She half rose to her feet as if to do it
herself, but sank back irresolutely.</p>

<p>A fresh wave of talk rolled forth.</p>

<p>"It'll half kill his aunt."</p>

<p>"Poor Miss Elder! I don't know what
she'll do!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what <i>he'll</i> do. He can't go
back to college."</p>

<p>"He'll have to go to work."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know where&mdash;nobody'd hire
him in this town."</p>

<p>The girl could bear it no longer. She
came to the door, and there, as they paused
to speak to her, her purpose ebbed again.</p>

<p>"My daughter, Vivian, Mrs. Williams,"
said her mother; and the other callers
greeted her familiarly.</p>

<p>"You'd better finish your lessons, Vivian,"
Mr. Lane suggested.</p>

<p>"I have, father," said the girl, and took
a chair by the minister's wife. She
had a vague feeling that if she were
there, they would not talk so about Morton
Elder.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Williams hailed the interruption
gratefully. She liked the slender girl with
the thoughtful eyes and pretty, rather pathetic
mouth, and sought to draw her out.
But her questions soon led to unfortunate
results.</p>

<p>"You are going to college, I suppose?"
she presently inquired; and Vivian owned
that it was the desire of her heart.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said her father. "Stuff and
nonsense, Vivian! You're not going to college."</p>

<p>The Foote girls now burst forth in voluble
agreement with Mr. Lane. His wife
was evidently of the same mind; and Mrs.
Williams plainly regretted her question.
But Vivian mustered courage enough to
make a stand, strengthened perhaps by the
depth of the feeling which had brought her
into the room.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you're all so down on
a girl's going to college. Eve Marks has
gone, and Mary Spring is going&mdash;and both
the Austin girls. Everybody goes now."</p>

<p>"I know one girl that won't," was her
father's incisive comment, and her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
said quietly, "A girl's place is at home&mdash;'till
she marries."</p>

<p>"Suppose I don't want to marry?" said
Vivian.</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense," her father answered.
"Marriage is a woman's duty."</p>

<p>"What do you want to do?" asked Miss
Josie in the interests of further combat.
"Do you want to be a doctor, like Jane
Bellair?"</p>

<p>"I should like to very much indeed," said
the girl with quiet intensity. "I'd like to
be a doctor in a babies' hospital."</p>

<p>"More nonsense," said Mr. Lane. "Don't
talk to me about that woman! You attend
to your studies, and then to your home
duties, my dear."</p>

<p>The talk rose anew, the three sisters contriving
all to agree with Mr. Lane in his
opinions about college, marriage and Dr.
Bellair, yet to disagree violently among
themselves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams rose to go, and in the lull
that followed the liquid note of a whippoorwill
met the girl's quick ear. She quietly
slipped out, unnoticed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>The Lane's home stood near the outer
edge of the town, with an outlook across
wide meadows and soft wooded hills. Behind,
their long garden backed on that of
Miss Orella Elder, with a connecting gate
in the gray board fence. Mrs. Lane had
grown up here. The house belonged to her
mother, Mrs. Servilla Pettigrew, though
that able lady was seldom in it, preferring
to make herself useful among two growing
sets of grandchildren.</p>

<p>Miss Elder was Vivian's favorite teacher.
She was a careful and conscientious instructor,
and the girl was a careful and conscientious
scholar; so they got on admirably
together; indeed, there was a real affection
between them. And just as the young
Laura Pettigrew had played with the
younger Orella Elder, so Vivian had played
with little Susie Elder, Miss Orella's orphan
niece. Susie regarded the older girl with
worshipful affection, which was not at all
unpleasant to an emotional young creature
with unemotional parents, and no brothers
or sisters of her own.</p>

<p>Moreover, Susie was Morton's sister.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>The whippoorwill's cry sounded again
through the soft June night. Vivian came
quickly down the garden path between the
bordering beds of sweet alyssum and mignonette.
A dew-wet rose brushed against
her hand. She broke it off, pricking her
fingers, and hastily fastened it in the bosom
of her white frock.</p>

<p>Large old lilac bushes hung over the dividing
fence, a thick mass of honeysuckle
climbed up by the gate and mingled with
them, spreading over to a pear tree on the
Lane side. In this fragrant, hidden corner
was a rough seat, and from it a boy's hand
reached out and seized the girl's, drawing her
down beside him. She drew away from him
as far as the seat allowed.</p>

<p>"Oh Morton!" she said. "What have you
done?"</p>

<p>Morton was sulky.</p>

<p>"Now Vivian, are you down on me too?
I thought I had one friend."</p>

<p>"You ought to tell me," she said more
gently. "How can I be your friend if I don't
know the facts? They are saying perfectly
awful things."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;the Foote girls&mdash;everybody."</p>

<p>"Oh those old maids aren't everybody, I
assure you. You see, Vivian, you live right
here in this old oyster of a town&mdash;and you
make mountains out of molehills like everybody
else. A girl of your intelligence ought
to know better."</p>

<p>She drew a great breath of relief. "Then
you haven't&mdash;done it?"</p>

<p>"Done what? What's all this mysterious
talk anyhow? The prisoner has a right to
know what he's charged with before he commits
himself."</p>

<p>The girl was silent, finding it difficult to
begin.</p>

<p>"Well, out with it. What do they say I
did?" He picked up a long dry twig and
broke it, gradually, into tiny, half-inch bits.</p>

<p>"They say you&mdash;went to the city&mdash;with a
lot of the worst boys in college&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well? Many persons go to the city
every day. That's no crime, surely. As for
'the worst boys in college,'"&mdash;he laughed
scornfully&mdash;"I suppose those old ladies
think if a fellow smokes a cigarette or says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
'darn' he's a tough. They're mighty nice
fellows, that bunch&mdash;most of 'em. Got some
ginger in 'em, that's all. What else?"</p>

<p>"They say&mdash;you drank."</p>

<p>"O ho! Said I got drunk, I warrant!
Well&mdash;we did have a skate on that time, I
admit!" And he laughed as if this charge
were but a familiar joke.</p>

<p>"Why Morton Elder! I think it is a&mdash;disgrace!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Vivian!&mdash;You ought to have
more sense. All the fellows get gay once in
a while. A college isn't a young ladies'
seminary."</p>

<p>He reached out and got hold of her hand
again, but she drew it away.</p>

<p>"There was something else," she said.</p>

<p>"What was it?" he questioned sharply.
"What did they say?"</p>

<p>But she would not satisfy him&mdash;perhaps
could not.</p>

<p>"I should think you'd be ashamed, to make
your aunt so much trouble. They said you
were suspended&mdash;or&mdash;<i>expelled</i>!"</p>

<p>He shrugged his big shoulders and threw
away the handful of broken twigs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>"That's true enough&mdash;I might as well admit
that."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Morton</i>!&mdash;I didn't believe it. <i>Expelled!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, expelled&mdash;turned down&mdash;thrown
out&mdash;fired! And I'm glad of it." He
leaned back against the fence and whistled
very softly through his teeth.</p>

<p>"Sh! Sh!" she urged. "Please!"</p>

<p>He was quiet.</p>

<p>"But Morton&mdash;what are you going to do?&mdash;Won't
it spoil your career?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear little girl, it will not!" said
he. "On the contrary, it will be the making
of me. I tell you, Vivian, I'm sick to death
of this town of maiden ladies&mdash;and 'good
family men.' I'm sick of being fussed over
for ever and ever, and having wristers and
mufflers knitted for me&mdash;and being told to
put on my rubbers! There's no fun in this
old clamshell&mdash;this kitchen-midden of a town&mdash;and
I'm going to quit it."</p>

<p>He stood up and stretched his long arms.
"I'm going to quit it for good and all."</p>

<p>The girl sat still, her hands gripping the
seat on either side.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she asked in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"I'm going west&mdash;clear out west. I've
been talking with Aunt Rella about it. Dr.
Bellair'll help me to a job, she thinks. She's
awful cut up, of course. I'm sorry she feels
bad&mdash;but she needn't, I tell her. I shall do
better there than I ever should have here.
I know a fellow that left college&mdash;his father
failed&mdash;and he went into business and made
two thousand dollars in a year. I always
wanted to take up business&mdash;you know
that!"</p>

<p>She knew it&mdash;he had talked of it freely
before they had argued and persuaded him
into the college life. She knew, too, how
his aunt's hopes all centered in him, and in
his academic honors and future professional
life. "Business," to his aunt's mind, was a
necessary evil, which could at best be undertaken
only after a "liberal education."</p>

<p>"When are you going," she asked at
length.</p>

<p>"Right off&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

<p>She gave a little gasp.</p>

<p>"That's what I was whippoorwilling about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>&mdash;I
knew I'd get no other chance to talk to
you&mdash;I wanted to say good-by, you know."</p>

<p>The girl sat silent, struggling not to cry.
He dropped beside her, stole an arm about
her waist, and felt her tremble.</p>

<p>"Now, Viva, don't you go and cry! I'm
sorry&mdash;I really am sorry&mdash;to make <i>you</i> feel
bad."</p>

<p>This was too much for her, and she sobbed
frankly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Morton! How could you! How
could you!&mdash;And now you've got to go
away!"</p>

<p>"There now&mdash;don't cry&mdash;sh!&mdash;they'll hear
you."</p>

<p>She did hush at that.</p>

<p>"And don't feel so bad&mdash;I'll come back
some time&mdash;to see you."</p>

<p>"No, you won't!" she answered with sudden
fierceness. "You'll just go&mdash;and stay&mdash;and
I never shall see you again!"</p>

<p>He drew her closer to him. "And do you
care&mdash;so much&mdash;Viva?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I care!" she said, "Haven't
we always been friends, the best of friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you and Aunt Rella have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
about all I had," he admitted with a cheerful
laugh. "I hope I'll make more friends out
yonder. But Viva,"&mdash;his hand pressed
closer&mdash;"is it only&mdash;friends?"</p>

<p>She took fright at once and drew
away from him. "You mustn't do that,
Morton!"</p>

<p>"Do what?" A shaft of moonlight shone
on his teasing face. "What am I doing?"
he said.</p>

<p>It is difficult&mdash;it is well nigh impossible&mdash;for
a girl to put a name to certain small cuddlings
not in themselves terrifying, nor even
unpleasant, but which she obscurely feels to
be wrong.</p>

<p>Viva flushed and was silent&mdash;he could see
the rich color flood her face.</p>

<p>"Come now&mdash;don't be hard on a fellow!"
he urged. "I shan't see you again in ever so
long. You'll forget all about me before a
year's over."</p>

<p>She shook her head, still silent.</p>

<p>"Won't you speak to me&mdash;Viva?"</p>

<p>"I wish&mdash;&mdash;" She could not find the
words she wanted. "Oh, I wish you&mdash;wouldn't!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>"Wouldn't what, Girlie? Wouldn't go
away? Sorry to disoblige&mdash;but I have to.
There's no place for me here."</p>

<p>The girl felt the sad truth of that.</p>

<p>"Aunt Rella will get used to it after a
while. I'll write to her&mdash;I'll make lots of
money&mdash;and come back in a few years&mdash;astonish
you all!&mdash;Meanwhile&mdash;kiss me good-by,
Viva!"</p>

<p>She drew back shyly. She had never
kissed him. She had never in her life kissed
any man younger than an uncle.</p>

<p>"No, Morton&mdash;you mustn't&mdash;&mdash;" She
shrank away into the shadow.</p>

<p>But, there was no great distance to shrink
to, and his strong arms soon drew her close
again.</p>

<p>"Suppose you never see me again," he
said. "Then you'll wish you hadn't been so
stiff about it."</p>

<p>She thought of this dread possibility with
a sudden chill of horror, and while she hesitated,
he took her face between her hands
and kissed her on the mouth.</p>

<p>Steps were heard coming down the
path.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>"They're on," he said with a little laugh.
"Good-by, Viva!"</p>

<p>He vaulted the fence and was gone.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Vivian?" demanded
her father.</p>

<p>"I was saying good-by to Morton," she
answered with a sob.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself&mdash;philandering
out here in the middle of the
night with that scapegrace! Come in the
house and go to bed at once&mdash;it's ten
o'clock."</p>

<p>Bowing to this confused but almost
equally incriminating chronology, she followed
him in, meekly enough as to her outward
seeming, but inwardly in a state of
stormy tumult.</p>

<p>She had been kissed!</p>

<p>Her father's stiff back before her could
not blot out the radiant, melting moonlight,
the rich sweetness of the flowers, the tender,
soft, June night.</p>

<p>"You go to bed," said he once more. "I'm
ashamed of you."</p>

<p>"Yes, father," she answered.</p>

<p>Her little room, when at last she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
safely in it and had shut the door and put a
chair against it&mdash;she had no key&mdash;seemed
somehow changed.</p>

<p>She lit the lamp and stood looking at herself
in the mirror. Her eyes were star-bright.
Her cheeks flamed softly. Her mouth looked
guilty and yet glad.</p>

<p>She put the light out and went to the
window, kneeling there, leaning out in the
fragrant stillness, trying to arrange in her
mind this mixture of grief, disapproval,
shame and triumph.</p>

<p>When the Episcopal church clock struck
eleven, she went to bed in guilty haste, but
not to sleep.</p>

<p>For a long time she lay there watching
the changing play of moonlight on the floor.</p>

<p>She felt almost as if she were married.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>At the two front windows of their
rather crowded little parlor sat
Miss Rebecca and Miss Josie
Foote, Miss Sallie being out on a foraging
expedition&mdash;marketing, as it were, among
their neighbors to collect fresh food for
thought.</p>

<p>A tall, slender girl in brown passed on the
opposite walk.</p>

<p>"I should think Vivian Lane would get
tired of wearing brown," said Miss Rebecca.</p>

<p>"I don't know why she should," her sister
promptly protested, "it's a good enough
wearing color, and becoming to her."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>"She could afford to have more variety,"
said Miss Rebecca. "The Lanes are mean
enough about some things, but I know they'd
like to have her dress better. She'll never
get married in the world."</p>

<p>"I don't know why not. She's only
twenty-five&mdash;and good-looking."</p>

<p>"Good-looking! That's not everything.
Plenty of girls marry that are not good-looking&mdash;and
plenty of good-looking girls
stay single."</p>

<p>"Plenty of homely ones, too. Rebecca,"
said Miss Josie, with meaning. Miss Rebecca
certainly was not handsome. "Going
to the library, of course!" she pursued presently.
"That girl reads all the time."</p>

<p>"So does her grandmother. I see her going
and coming from that library every day
almost."</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;she reads stories and things
like that. Sallie goes pretty often and she
notices. We use that library enough, goodness
knows, but they are there every day.
Vivian Lane reads the queerest things&mdash;doctor's
books and works on pedagoggy."</p>

<p>"Godgy," said Miss Rebecca, "not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
goggy." And as her sister ignored this correction,
she continued: "They might as well
have let her go to college when she was so
set on it."</p>

<p>"College! I don't believe she'd have
learned as much in any college, from what
I hear of 'em, as she has in all this time at
home." The Foote girls had never entertained
a high opinion of extensive culture.</p>

<p>"I don't see any use in a girl's studying so
much," said Miss Rebecca with decision.</p>

<p>"Nor I," agreed Miss Josie. "Men don't
like learned women."</p>

<p>"They don't seem to always like those
that aren't learned, either," remarked Miss
Rebecca with a pleasant sense of retribution
for that remark about "homely ones."</p>

<p>The tall girl in brown had seen the two
faces at the windows opposite, and had held
her shoulders a little straighter as she turned
the corner.</p>

<p>"Nine years this Summer since Morton
Elder went West," murmured Miss Josie,
reminiscently. "I shouldn't wonder if Vivian
had stayed single on his account."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" her sister answered sharply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
"She's not that kind. She's not popular
with men, that's all. She's too intellectual."</p>

<p>"She ought to be in the library instead of
Sue Elder," Miss Rebecca suggested. "She's
far more competent. Sue's a feather-headed
little thing."</p>

<p>"She seems to give satisfaction so far.
If the trustees are pleased with her, there's
no reason for you to complain that I see,"
said Miss Rebecca with decision.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Vivian Lane waited at the library desk
with an armful of books to take home. She
had her card, her mother's and her father's&mdash;all
utilized. Her grandmother kept her
own card&mdash;and her own counsel.</p>

<p>The pretty assistant librarian, withdrawing
herself with some emphasis from the
unnecessary questions of a too gallant old
gentleman, came to attend her.</p>

<p>"You <i>have</i> got a load," she said, scribbling
complex figures with one end of her hammer-headed
pencil, and stamping violet dates
with the other. She whisked out the pale
blue slips from the lid pockets, dropped
them into their proper openings in the desk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
and inserted the cards in their stead with
delicate precision.</p>

<p>"Can't you wait a bit and go home
with me?" she asked. "I'll help you carry
them."</p>

<p>"No, thanks. I'm not going right
home."</p>

<p>"You're going to see your Saint&mdash;I
know!" said Miss Susie, tossing her bright
head. "I'm jealous, and you know it."</p>

<p>"Don't be a goose, Susie! You know
you're my very best friend, but&mdash;she's different."</p>

<p>"I should think she was different!" Susie
sharply agreed. "And you've been 'different'
ever since she came."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Vivian gravely. "Mrs.
St. Cloud brings out one's very best and
highest. I wish you liked her better, Susie."</p>

<p>"I like you," Susie answered. "You bring
out my 'best and highest'&mdash;if I've got any.
She don't. She's like a lovely, faint, bright&mdash;bubble!
I want to prick it!"</p>

<p>Vivian smiled down upon her.</p>

<p>"You bad little mouse!" she said. "Come,
give me the books."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>"Leave them with me, and I'll bring them
in the car." Susie looked anxious to make
amends for her bit of blasphemy.</p>

<p>"All right, dear. Thank you. I'll be
home by that time, probably."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the street she stopped before a little
shop where papers and magazines were sold.</p>

<p>"I believe Father'd like the new Centurion,"
she said to herself, and got it for him,
chatting a little with the one-armed man who
kept the place. She stopped again at a
small florist's and bought a little bag of
bulbs.</p>

<p>"Your mother's forgotten about those, I
guess," said Mrs. Crothers, the florist's wife,
"but they'll do just as well now. Lucky you
thought of them before it got too late in
the season. Bennie was awfully pleased with
that red and blue pencil you gave him, Miss
Lane."</p>

<p>Vivian walked on. A child ran out suddenly
from a gate and seized upon her.</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming in to see me&mdash;ever?"
she demanded.</p>

<p>Vivian stooped and kissed her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dear, but not to-night. How's that
dear baby getting on?"</p>

<p>"She's better," said the little girl. "Mother
said thank you&mdash;lots of times. Wait a minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>The child fumbled in Vivian's coat pocket
with a mischievous upward glance, fished out
a handful of peanuts, and ran up the path
laughing while the tall girl smiled down upon
her lovingly.</p>

<p>A long-legged boy was lounging along
the wet sidewalk. Vivian caught up with
him and he joined her with eagerness.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Miss Lane. Say&mdash;are
you coming to the club to-morrow
night?"</p>

<p>She smiled cordially.</p>

<p>"Of course I am, Johnny. I wouldn't
disappoint my boys for anything&mdash;nor myself,
either."</p>

<p>They walked on together chatting until,
at the minister's house, she bade him a
cheery "good-night."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Cloud was at the window pensively
watching the western sky. She saw
the girl coming and let her in with a tender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
radiant smile&mdash;a lovely being in a most unlovely
room.</p>

<p>There was a chill refinement above subdued
confusion in that Cambridge-Bainville
parlor, where the higher culture of the
second Mrs. Williams, superimposed upon
the lower culture of the first, as that upon
the varying tastes of a combined ancestry,
made the place somehow suggestive of excavations
at Abydos.</p>

<p>It was much the kind of parlor Vivian
had been accustomed to from childhood,
but Mrs. St. Cloud was of a type quite new
to her. Clothed in soft, clinging fabrics,
always with a misty, veiled effect to them,
wearing pale amber, large, dull stones of
uncertain shapes, and slender chains that
glittered here and there among her scarfs
and laces, sinking gracefully among deep
cushions, even able to sink gracefully into
a common Bainville chair&mdash;this beautiful
woman had captured the girl's imagination
from the first.</p>

<p>Clearly known, she was a sister of Mrs.
Williams, visiting indefinitely. Vaguely&mdash;and
very frequently&mdash;hinted, her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
had "left her," and "she did not believe in
divorce." Against her background of dumb
patience, he shone darkly forth as A Brute
of unknown cruelties. Nothing against him
would she ever say, and every young masculine
heart yearned to make life brighter to
the Ideal Woman, so strangely neglected;
also some older ones. Her Young Men's
Bible Class was the pride of Mr. Williams'
heart and joy of such young men as the
town possessed; most of Bainville's boys
had gone.</p>

<p>"A wonderful uplifting influence," Mr.
Williams called her, and refused to say anything,
even when directly approached, as
to "the facts" of her trouble. "It is an old
story," he would say. "She bears up wonderfully.
She sacrifices her life rather than
her principles."</p>

<p>To Vivian, sitting now on a hassock at
the lady's feet and looking up at her with
adoring eyes, she was indeed a star, a saint,
a cloud of mystery.</p>

<p>She reached out a soft hand, white, slender,
delicately kept, wearing one thin gold
ring, and stroked the girl's smooth hair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Vivian seized the hand and kissed it, blushing
as she did so.</p>

<p>"You foolish child! Don't waste your
young affection on an old lady like me."</p>

<p>"Old! You! You don't look as old as I
do this minute!" said the girl with hushed
intensity.</p>

<p>"Life wears on you, I'm afraid, my dear....
Do you ever hear from him?"</p>

<p>To no one else, not even to Susie, could
Vivian speak of what now seemed the
tragedy of her lost youth.</p>

<p>"No," said she. "Never now. He did
write once or twice&mdash;at first."</p>

<p>"He writes to his aunt, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Vivian. "But not often.
And he never&mdash;says anything."</p>

<p>"I understand. Poor child! You must
be true, and wait." And the lady turned
the thin ring on her finger. Vivian watched
her in a passion of admiring tenderness.</p>

<p>"Oh, you understand!" she exclaimed.
"You understand!"</p>

<p>"I understand, my dear," said Mrs. St.
Cloud.</p>

<p>When Vivian reached her own gate she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
leaned her arms upon it and looked first one
way and then the other, down the long, still
street. The country was in sight at both
ends&mdash;the low, monotonous, wooded hills
that shut them in. It was all familiar, wearingly
familiar. She had known it continuously
for such part of her lifetime as was
sensitive to landscape effects, and had at
times a mad wish for an earthquake to
change the outlines a little.</p>

<p>The infrequent trolley car passed just
then and Sue Elder joined her, to take the
short cut home through the Lane's yard.</p>

<p>"Here you are," she said cheerfully, "and
here are the books."</p>

<p>Vivian thanked her.</p>

<p>"Oh, say&mdash;come in after supper, can't
you? Aunt Rella's had another letter from
Mort."</p>

<p>Vivian's sombre eyes lit up a little.</p>

<p>"How's he getting on? In the same business
he was last year?" she asked with an
elaborately cheerful air. Morton had
seemed to change occupations oftener than
he wrote letters.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so. I guess he's well. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
never says much, you know. I don't think
it's good for him out there&mdash;good for any
boy." And Susie looked quite the older
sister.</p>

<p>"What are they to do? They can't stay
here."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not&mdash;but we have to."</p>

<p>"Dr. Bellair didn't," remarked Vivian.
"I like her&mdash;tremendously, don't you?" In
truth, Dr. Bellair was already a close second
to Mrs. St. Cloud in the girl's hero-worshipping
heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; she's splendid! Aunt Rella is
so glad to have her with us. They have
great times recalling their school days together.
Aunty used to like her then, though
she is five years older&mdash;but you'd never
dream it. And I think she's real handsome."</p>

<p>"She's not beautiful," said Vivian, with
decision, "but she's a lot better. Sue Elder,
I wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wish what?" asked her friend.</p>

<p>Sue put the books on the gate-post, and
the two girls, arm in arm, walked slowly up
and down.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>Susie was a round, palely rosy little person,
with a delicate face and soft, light hair
waving fluffily about her small head. Vivian's
hair was twice the length, but so straight
and fine that its mass had no effect. She
wore it in smooth plaits wound like a wreath
from brow to nape.</p>

<p>After an understanding silence and a walk
past three gates and back again, Vivian
answered her.</p>

<p>"I wish I were in your shoes," she said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;having the Doctor
in the house?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I'd like that too; but I mean work
to do&mdash;your position."</p>

<p>"Oh, the library! You needn't; it's horrid.
I wish I were in your shoes, and had
a father and mother to take care of me. I
can tell you, it's no fun&mdash;having to be there
just on time or get fined, and having to poke
away all day with those phooty old ladies
and tiresome children."</p>

<p>"But you're independent."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'm independent. I have to be.
Aunt Rella <i>could</i> take care of me, I suppose,
but of course I wouldn't let her. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
I dare say library work is better than school-teaching."</p>

<p>"What'll we be doing when we're forty,
I wonder?" said Vivian, after another turn.</p>

<p>"Forty! Why I expect to be a grandma
by that time," said Sue. She was but
twenty-one, and forty looked a long way off
to her.</p>

<p>"A grandma! And knit?" suggested
Vivian.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;baby jackets&mdash;and blankets&mdash;and
socks&mdash;and little shawls. I love to
knit," said Sue, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"But suppose you don't marry?" pursued
her friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I shall marry&mdash;you see if I don't.
Marriage"&mdash;here she carefully went inside
the gate and latched it&mdash;"marriage is&mdash;a
woman's duty!" And she ran up the path
laughing.</p>

<p>Vivian laughed too, rather grimly, and
slowly walked towards her own door.</p>

<p>The little sitting-room was hot, very hot;
but Mr. Lane sat with his carpet-slippered
feet on its narrow hearth with a shawl around
him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>"Shut the door, Vivian!" he exclaimed
irritably. "I'll never get over this cold if
such draughts are let in on me."</p>

<p>"Why, it's not cold out, Father&mdash;and it's
very close in here."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane looked up from her darning.
"You think it's close because you've come
in from outdoors. Sit down&mdash;and don't fret
your father; I'm real worried about
him."</p>

<p>Mr. Lane coughed hollowly. He had become
a little dry old man with gray, glassy
eyes, and had been having colds in this
fashion ever since Vivian could remember.</p>

<p>"Dr. Bellair says that the out-door air is
the best medicine for a cold," remarked Vivian,
as she took off her things.</p>

<p>"Dr. Bellair has not been consulted in this
case," her father returned wheezingly. "I'm
quite satisfied with my family physician.
He's a man, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Save me from these women doctors!"
exclaimed his wife.</p>

<p>Vivian set her lips patiently. She had
long since learned how widely she differed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
from both father and mother, and preferred
silence to dispute.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane was a plain, ordinary person,
who spent most of a moderately useful life
in the shoe business, from which he had of
late withdrawn. Both he and his wife "had
property" to a certain extent; and now lived
peacefully on their income with neither fear
nor hope, ambition nor responsibility to
trouble them. The one thing they were yet
anxious about was to see Vivian married,
but this wish seemed to be no nearer to fulfillment
for the passing years.</p>

<p>"I don't know what the women are thinking
of, these days," went on the old gentleman,
putting another shovelful of coal on the
fire with a careful hand. "Doctors and lawyers
and even ministers, some of 'em! The
Lord certainly set down a woman's duty
pretty plain&mdash;she was to cleave unto her
husband!"</p>

<p>"Some women have no husbands to cleave
to, Father."</p>

<p>"They'd have husbands fast enough if
they'd behave themselves," he answered.
"No man's going to want to marry one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
these self-sufficient independent, professional
women, of course."</p>

<p>"I do hope, Viva," said her mother, "that
you're not letting that Dr. Bellair put foolish
ideas into your head."</p>

<p>"I want to do something to support myself&mdash;sometime,
Mother. I can't live on my
parents forever."</p>

<p>"You be patient, child. There's money
enough for you to live on. It's a woman's
place to wait," put in Mr. Lane.</p>

<p>"How long?" inquired Vivian. "I'm
twenty-five. No man has asked me to marry
him yet. Some of the women in this town
have waited thirty&mdash;forty&mdash;fifty&mdash;sixty
years. No one has asked them."</p>

<p>"I was married at sixteen," suddenly remarked
Vivian's grandmother. "And my
mother wasn't but fifteen. Huh!" A sudden
little derisive noise she made; such as
used to be written "humph!"</p>

<p>For the past five years, Mrs. Pettigrew
had made her home with the Lanes. Mrs.
Lane herself was but a feeble replica of her
energetic parent. There was but seventeen
years difference in their ages, and compara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>tive
idleness with some ill-health on the part
of the daughter, had made the difference
appear less.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew had but a poor opinion of
the present generation. In her active youth
she had reared a large family on a small income;
in her active middle-age, she had
trotted about from daughter's house to son's
house, helping with the grandchildren. And
now she still trotted about in all weathers,
visiting among the neighbors and vibrating
as regularly as a pendulum between her
daughter's house and the public library.</p>

<p>The books she brought home were mainly
novels, and if she perused anything else in
the severe quiet of the reading-room, she
did not talk about it. Indeed, it was a
striking characteristic of Mrs. Pettigrew
that she talked very little, though she listened
to all that went on with a bright and
beady eye, as of a highly intelligent parrot.
And now, having dropped her single remark
into the conversation, she shut her lips tight
as was her habit, and drew another ball of
worsted from the black bag that always
hung at her elbow.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>She was making one of those perennial
knitted garments, which, in her young days,
were called "Cardigan jackets," later "Jerseys,"
and now by the offensive name of
"sweater." These she constructed in great
numbers, and their probable expense was
a source of discussion in the town. "How
do you find friends enough to give them to?"
they asked her, and she would smile enigmatically
and reply, "Good presents make
good friends."</p>

<p>"If a woman minds her P's and Q's she
can get a husband easy enough," insisted the
invalid. "Just shove that lamp nearer, Vivian,
will you."</p>

<p>Vivian moved the lamp. Her mother
moved her chair to follow it and dropped
her darning egg, which the girl handed to
her.</p>

<p>"Supper's ready," announced a hard-featured
middle-aged woman, opening the dining-room
door.</p>

<p>At this moment the gate clicked, and a
firm step was heard coming up the path.</p>

<p>"Gracious, that's the minister!" cried Mrs.
Lane. "He said he'd be in this afternoon if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
he got time. I thought likely 'twould be to
supper."</p>

<p>She received him cordially, and insisted
on his staying, slipping out presently to
open a jar of quinces.</p>

<p>The Reverend Otis Williams was by no
means loathe to take occasional meals with
his parishioners. It was noted that, in making
pastoral calls, he began with the poorer
members of his flock, and frequently arrived
about meal-time at the houses of those whose
cooking he approved.</p>

<p>"It is always a treat to take supper here,"
he said. "Not feeling well, Mr. Lane? I'm
sorry to hear it. Ah! Mrs. Pettigrew! Is
that jacket for me, by any chance? A little
sombre, isn't it? Good evening, Vivian.
You are looking well&mdash;as you always do."</p>

<p>Vivian did not like him. He had married
her mother, he had christened her, she had
"sat under" him for long, dull, uninterrupted
years; yet still she didn't like him.</p>

<p>"A chilly evening, Mr. Lane," he pursued.</p>

<p>"That's what I say," his host agreed.
"Vivian says it isn't; I say it is."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"Disagreement in the family! This won't
do, Vivian," said the minister jocosely.
"Duty to parents, you know! Duty to
parents!"</p>

<p>"Does duty to parents alter the temperature?"
the girl asked, in a voice of quiet
sweetness, yet with a rebellious spark in her
soft eyes.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said her grandmother&mdash;and
dropped her gray ball. Vivian picked it up
and the old lady surreptitiously patted her.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the reverend gentleman
to Mrs. Pettigrew, "did you speak?"</p>

<p>"No," said the old lady, "Seldom do."</p>

<p>"Silence is golden, Mrs. Pettigrew. Silence
is golden. Speech is silver, but silence
is golden. It is a rare gift."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew set her lips so tightly that
they quite disappeared, leaving only a thin
dented line in her smoothly pale face. She
was called by the neighbors "wonderfully
well preserved," a phrase she herself despised.
Some visitor, new to the town, had
the hardihood to use it to her face once.
"Huh!" was the response. "I'm just
sixty. Henry Haskins and George Baker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and Stephen Doolittle are all older'n I am&mdash;and
still doing business, doing it better'n any
of the young folks as far as I can see. You
don't compare them to canned pears, do
you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Williams knew her value in church
work, and took no umbrage at her somewhat
inimical expression; particularly as just
then Mrs. Lane appeared and asked them to
walk out to supper.</p>

<p>Vivian sat among them, restrained and
courteous, but inwardly at war with her
surroundings. Here was her mother, busy,
responsible, serving creamed codfish and hot
biscuit; her father, eating wheezily, and
finding fault with the biscuit, also with the
codfish; her grandmother, bright-eyed, thin-lipped
and silent. Vivian got on well with
her grandmother, though neither of them
talked much.</p>

<p>"My mother used to say that the perfect
supper was cake, preserves, hot bread, and
a 'relish,'" said Mr. Williams genially. "You
have the perfect supper, Mrs. Lane."</p>

<p>"I'm glad if you enjoy it, I'm sure," said
that lady. "I'm fond of a bit of salt myself."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>"And what are you reading now, Vivian,"
he asked paternally.</p>

<p>"Ward," she answered, modestly and
briefly.</p>

<p>"Ward? Dr. Ward of the <i>Centurion</i>?"</p>

<p>Vivian smiled her gentlest.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she replied; "Lester F. Ward,
the Sociologist."</p>

<p>"Poor stuff, I think!" said her father.
"Girls have no business to read such things."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd speak to Vivian about it,
Mr. Williams. She's got beyond me," protested
her mother.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Mrs. Pettigrew. "I'd like
some more of that quince, Laura."</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, you are not reading
books of which your parents disapprove, I
hope?" urged the minister.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't I&mdash;ever?" asked the girl, in
her soft, disarming manner. "I'm surely
old enough!"</p>

<p>"The duty of a daughter is not measured
by years," he replied sonorously. "Does
parental duty cease? Are you not yet a
child in your father's house?"</p>

<p>"Is a daughter always a child if she lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
at home?" inquired the girl, as one seeking
instruction.</p>

<p>He set down his cup and wiped his lips,
flushing somewhat.</p>

<p>"The duty of a daughter begins at the
age when she can understand the distinction
between right and wrong," he said, "and
continues as long as she is blessed with
parents."</p>

<p>"And what is it?" she asked, large-eyed,
attentive.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he repeated, looking at her
in some surprise. "It is submission, obedience&mdash;obedience."</p>

<p>"I see. So Mother ought to obey Grandmother,"
she pursued meditatively, and Mrs.
Pettigrew nearly choked in her tea.</p>

<p>Vivian was boiling with rebellion. To sit
there and be lectured at the table, to have
her father complain of her, her mother invite
pastoral interference, the minister
preach like that. She slapped her grandmother's
shoulder, readjusted the little knit
shawl on the straight back&mdash;and refrained
from further speech.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Pettigrew could talk, she de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>manded
suddenly of the minister, "Have
you read Campbell's New Theology?" and
from that on they were all occupied in listening
to Mr. Williams' strong, clear and
extensive views on the subject&mdash;which lasted
into the parlor again.</p>

<p>Vivian sat for awhile in the chair nearest
the window, where some thin thread of air
might possibly leak in, and watched the
minister with a curious expression. All her
life he had been held up to her as a person
to honor, as a man of irreproachable character,
great learning and wisdom. Of late
she found with a sense of surprise that she
did not honor him at all. He seemed to her
suddenly like a relic of past ages, a piece of
an old parchment&mdash;or papyrus. In the light
of the studies she had been pursuing in the
well-stored town library, the teachings of
this worthy old gentleman appeared a jumble
of age-old traditions, superimposed one
upon another.</p>

<p>"He's a palimpsest," she said to herself,
"and a poor palimpsest at that."</p>

<p>She sat with her shapely hands quiet in
her lap while her grandmother's shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
needles twinkled in the dark wool, and her
mother's slim crochet hook ran along the
widening spaces of some thin, white, fuzzy
thing. The rich powers of her young womanhood
longed for occupation, but she
could never hypnotize herself with "fancywork."
Her work must be worth while. She
felt the crushing cramp and loneliness of a
young mind, really stronger than those about
her, yet held in dumb subjection. She could
not solace herself by loving them; her father
would have none of it, and her mother had
small use for what she called "sentiment."
All her life Vivian had longed for more loving,
both to give and take; but no one ever
imagined it of her, she was so quiet and repressed
in manner. The local opinion was
that if a woman had a head, she could not
have a heart; and as to having a body&mdash;it
was indelicate to consider such a thing.</p>

<p>"I mean to have six children," Vivian had
planned when she was younger. "And they
shall never be hungry for more loving." She
meant to make up to her vaguely imagined
future family for all that her own youth
missed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>Even Grandma, though far more sympathetic
in temperament, was not given to
demonstration, and Vivian solaced her big,
tender heart by cuddling all the babies she
could reach, and petting cats and dogs when
no children were to be found.</p>

<p>Presently she arose and bade a courteous
goodnight to the still prolix parson.</p>

<p>"I'm going over to Sue's," she said, and
went out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a moon again&mdash;a low, large
moon, hazily brilliant. The air was sweet
with the odors of scarce-gone Summer, of
coming Autumn.</p>

<p>The girl stood still, half-way down the
path, and looked steadily into that silver
radiance. Moonlight always filled her heart
with a vague excitement, a feeling that
something ought to happen&mdash;soon.</p>

<p>This flat, narrow life, so long, so endlessly
long&mdash;would nothing ever end it?
Nine years since Morton went away! Nine
years since the strange, invading thrill of
her first kiss! Back of that was only childhood;
these years really constituted Life;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
and Life, in the girl's eyes, was a dreary
treadmill.</p>

<p>She was externally quiet, and by conscience
dutiful; so dutiful, so quiet, so without
powers of expression, that the ache of
an unsatisfied heart, the stir of young ambitions,
were wholly unsuspected by those
about her. A studious, earnest, thoughtful
girl&mdash;but study alone does not supply life's
needs, nor does such friendship as her life
afforded.</p>

<p>Susie was "a dear"&mdash;Susie was Morton's
sister, and she was very fond of her. But
that bright-haired child did not understand&mdash;could
not understand&mdash;all that she needed.</p>

<p>Then came Mrs. St. Cloud into her life,
stirring the depths of romance, of the buried
past, and of the unborn future. From her
she learned to face a life of utter renunciation,
to be true, true to her ideals, true to
her principles, true to the past, to be patient;
and to wait.</p>

<p>So strengthened, she had turned a deaf
ear to such possible voice of admiration as
might have come from the scant membership
of the Young Men's Bible Class, leav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>ing
them the more devoted to Scripture
study. There was no thin ring to turn upon
her finger; but, for lack of better token, she
had saved the rose she wore upon her breast
that night, keeping it hidden among her
precious things.</p>

<p>And then, into the gray, flat current of
her daily life, sharply across the trend of
Mrs. St. Cloud's soft influence, had come
a new force&mdash;Dr. Bellair.</p>

<p>Vivian liked her, yet felt afraid, a slight,
shivering hesitancy as before a too cold
bath, a subtle sense that this breezy woman,
strong, cheerful, full of new ideas, if not
ideals, and radiating actual power, power
used and enjoyed, might in some way change
the movement of her life.</p>

<p>Change she desired, she longed for, but
dreaded the unknown.</p>

<p>Slowly she followed the long garden path,
paused lingeringly by that rough garden
seat, went through and closed the gate.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Orella sat in her low armless
rocker, lifting perplexed, patient
eyes to look up at Dr. Bellair.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair stood squarely before her,
stood easily, on broad-soled, low-heeled
shoes, and looked down at Miss Orella; her
eyes were earnest, compelling, full of hope
and cheer.</p>

<p>"You are as pretty as a girl, Orella," she
observed irrelevantly.</p>

<p>Miss Orella blushed. She was not used to
compliments, even from a woman, and did
not know how to take them.</p>

<p>"How you talk!" she murmured shyly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean to talk," continued the doctor,
"until you listen to reason."</p>

<p>Reason in this case, to Dr. Bellair's mind,
lay in her advice to Miss Elder to come
West with her&mdash;to live.</p>

<p>"I don't see how I can. It's&mdash;it's such a
Complete Change."</p>

<p>Miss Orella spoke as if Change were
equivalent to Sin, or at least to Danger.</p>

<p>"Do you good. As a physician, I can
prescribe nothing better. You need a complete
change if anybody ever did."</p>

<p>"Why, Jane! I am quite well."</p>

<p>"I didn't say you were sick. But you are
in an advanced stage of <i>arthritis deformans</i>
of the soul. The whole town's got it!"</p>

<p>The doctor tramped up and down the little
room, freeing her mind.</p>

<p>"I never saw such bed-ridden intellects in
my life! I suppose it was so when I was a
child&mdash;and I was too young to notice it. But
surely it's worse now. The world goes faster
and faster every day, the people who keep
still get farther behind! I'm fond of you,
Rella. You've got an intellect, and a conscience,
and a will&mdash;a will like iron. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
you spend most of your strength in keeping
yourself down. Now, do wake up and use
it to break loose! You don't have to stay
here. Come out to Colorado with me&mdash;and
Grow."</p>

<p>Miss Elder moved uneasily in her chair.
She laid her small embroidery hoop on the
table, and straightened out the loose threads
of silk, the doctor watching her impatiently.</p>

<p>"I'm too old," she said at length.</p>

<p>Jane Bellair laughed aloud, shortly.</p>

<p>"Old!" she cried. "You're five years
younger than I am. You're only thirty-six!
Old! Why, child, your life's before you&mdash;to
make."</p>

<p>"You don't realize, Jane. You struck
out for yourself so young&mdash;and you've
grown up out there&mdash;it seems to be so different&mdash;there."</p>

<p>"It is. People aren't afraid to move.
What have you got here you so hate to leave,
Rella?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's&mdash;Home."</p>

<p>"Yes. It's home&mdash;now. Are you happy
in it?"</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;contented."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you deceive yourself, Rella. You
are not contented&mdash;not by a long chalk.
You are doing your duty as you see it; and
you've kept yourself down so long you've
almost lost the power of motion. I'm trying
to galvanize you awake&mdash;and I mean to
do it."</p>

<p>"You might as well sit down while you're
doing it, anyway," Miss Elder suggested
meekly.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair sat down, selecting a formidable
fiddle-backed chair, the unflinching determination
of its widely-placed feet being
repeated by her own square toes. She
placed herself in front of her friend and
leaned forward, elbows on knees, her strong,
intelligent hands clasped loosely.</p>

<p>"What have you got to look forward to,
Rella?"</p>

<p>"I want to see Susie happily married&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said <i>you</i>&mdash;not Susie."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;me? Why, I hope some day Morton
will come back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said <i>you</i>&mdash;not Morton."</p>

<p>"Why I&mdash;you know I have friends, Jane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
&mdash;and neighbors. And some day, perhaps&mdash;I
mean to go abroad."</p>

<p>"Are you scolding Aunt Rella again, Dr.
Bellair. I won't stand it." Pretty Susie
stood in the door smiling.</p>

<p>"Come and help me then," the doctor said,
"and it won't sound so much like scolding."</p>

<p>"I want Mort's letter&mdash;to show to Viva,"
the girl answered, and slipped out with it.</p>

<p>She sat with Vivian on the stiff little sofa
in the back room; the arms of the two girls
were around one another, and they read the
letter together. More than six months had
passed since his last one.</p>

<p>It was not much of a letter. Vivian took
it in her own hands and went through it
again, carefully. The "Remember me to
Viva&mdash;unless she's married," at the end did
not seem at all satisfying. Still it might
mean more than appeared&mdash;far more. Men
were reticent and proud, she had read. It
was perfectly possible that he might be concealing
deep emotion under the open friendliness.
He was in no condition to speak
freely, to come back and claim her. He did
not wish her to feel bound to him. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
discussed it with Mrs. St. Cloud, shrinkingly,
tenderly, led on by tactful, delicate,
questions, by the longing of her longing
heart for expression and sympathy.</p>

<p>"A man who cannot marry must speak of
marriage&mdash;it is not honorable," her friend
had told her.</p>

<p>"Couldn't he&mdash;write to me&mdash;as a
friend?"</p>

<p>And the low-voiced lady had explained
with a little sigh that men thought little of
friendship with women. "I have tried, all
my life, to be a true and helpful friend to
men, to such men as seemed worthy, and
they so often&mdash;misunderstood."</p>

<p>The girl, sympathetic and admiring,
thought hotly of how other people misunderstood
this noble, lovely soul; how they
even hinted that she "tried to attract men,"
a deadly charge in Bainville.</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. St. Cloud had told her, "he
might love you better than all the world&mdash;yet
not write to you&mdash;till he was ready to
say 'come.' And, of course, he wouldn't say
anything in his letters to his aunt."</p>

<p>So Vivian sat there, silent, weaving frail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
dreams out of "remember me to Viva&mdash;unless
she's married." That last clause might
mean much.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair's voice sounded clear and insistent
in the next room.</p>

<p>"She's trying to persuade Aunt Rella to
go West!" said Susie. "Wouldn't it be
funny if she did!"</p>

<p>In Susie's eyes her Aunt's age was as the
age of mountains, and also her fixity. Since
she could remember, Aunt Rella, always
palely pretty and neat, like the delicate,
faintly-colored Spring flowers of New England,
had presided over the small white
house, the small green garden and the large
black and white school-room. In her vacation
she sewed, keeping that quiet wardrobe
of hers in exquisite order&mdash;and also making
Susie's pretty dresses. To think of Aunt
Orella actually "breaking up housekeeping,"
giving up her school, leaving Bainville, was
like a vision of trees walking.</p>

<p>To Dr. Jane Bellair, forty-one, vigorous,
successful, full of new plans and purposes,
Miss Elder's life appeared as an arrested
girlhood, stagnating unnecessarily in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
quiet town, while all the world was open to
her.</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of leaving Susie!" protested
Miss Orella.</p>

<p>"Bring her along," said the doctor. "Best
thing in the world for her!"</p>

<p>She rose and came to the door. The two
girls make a pretty picture. Vivian's oval
face, with its smooth Madonna curves under
the encircling wreath of soft, dark plaits,
and the long grace of her figure, delicately
built, yet strong, beside the pink, plump little
Susie, roguish and pretty, with the look
that made everyone want to take care of her.</p>

<p>"Come in here, girls," said the doctor. "I
want you to help me. You're young enough
to be movable, I hope."</p>

<p>They cheerfully joined the controversy,
but Miss Orella found small support in
them.</p>

<p>"Why don't you do it, Auntie!" Susie
thought it an excellent joke. "I suppose you
could teach school in Denver as well as here.
And you could Vote! Oh, Auntie&mdash;to think
of your Voting!"</p>

<p>Miss Elder, too modestly feminine, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
inherently conservative even to be an outspoken
"Anti," fairly blushed at the idea.</p>

<p>"She's hesitating on your account," Dr.
Bellair explained to the girl. "Wants to
see you safely married! I tell her you'll
have a thousandfold better opportunities in
Colorado than you ever will here."</p>

<p>Vivian was grieved. She had heard
enough of this getting married, and had expected
Dr. Bellair to hold a different position.</p>

<p>"Surely, that's not the only thing to do,"
she protested.</p>

<p>"No, but it's a very important thing to
do&mdash;and to do right. It's a woman's duty."</p>

<p>Vivian groaned in spirit. That again!</p>

<p>The doctor watched her understandingly.</p>

<p>"If women only did their duty in that line
there wouldn't be so much unhappiness in
the world," she said. "All you New England
girls sit here and cut one another's
throats. You can't possible marry, your
boys go West, you overcrowd the labor market,
lower wages, steadily drive the weakest
sisters down till they&mdash;drop."</p>

<p>They heard the back door latch lift and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
close again, a quick, decided step&mdash;and Mrs.
Pettigrew joined them.</p>

<p>Miss Elder greeted her cordially, and the
old lady seated herself in the halo of the
big lamp, as one well accustomed to the
chair.</p>

<p>"Go right on," she said&mdash;and knitted
briskly.</p>

<p>"Do take my side, Mrs. Pettigrew," Miss
Orella implored her. "Jane Bellair is trying
to pull me up by the roots and transplant
me to Colorado."</p>

<p>"And she says I shall have a better chance
to marry out there&mdash;and ought to do it!"
said Susie, very solemnly. "And Vivian
objects to being shown the path of duty."</p>

<p>Vivian smiled. Her quiet, rather sad face
lit with sudden sparkling beauty when she
smiled.</p>

<p>"Grandma knows I hate that&mdash;point of
view," she said. "I think men and women
ought to be friends, and not always be thinking
about&mdash;that."</p>

<p>"I have some real good friends&mdash;boys, I
mean," Susie agreed, looking so serious in
her platonic boast that even Vivian was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
little amused, and Dr. Bellair laughed outright.</p>

<p>"You won't have a 'friend' in that sense
till you're fifty, Miss Susan&mdash;if you ever do.
There can be, there are, real friendships between
men and women, but most of that talk
is&mdash;talk, sometimes worse.</p>

<p>"I knew a woman once, ever so long ago,"
the doctor continued musingly, clasping her
hands behind her head, "a long way from
here&mdash;in a college town&mdash;who talked about
'friends.' She was married. She was a
'good' woman&mdash;perfectly 'good' woman.
Her husband was not a very good man, I've
heard, and strangely impatient of her virtues.
She had a string of boys&mdash;college
boys&mdash;always at her heels. Quite too young
and too charming she was for this friendship
game. She said that such a friendship was
'an ennobling influence' for the boys. She
called them her 'acolytes.' Lots of them
were fairly mad about her&mdash;one young chap
was so desperate over it that he shot himself."</p>

<p>There was a pained silence.</p>

<p>"I don't see what this has to do with going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
to Colorado," said Mrs. Pettigrew, looking
from one to the other with a keen, observing
eye. "What's your plan, Dr. Bellair?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm trying to persuade my old
friend here to leave this place, change her
occupation, come out to Colorado with me,
and grow up. She's a case of arrested development."</p>

<p>"She wants me to keep boarders!" Miss
Elder plaintively protested to Mrs. Pettigrew.</p>

<p>That lady was not impressed.</p>

<p>"It's quite a different matter out there,
Mrs. Pettigrew," the doctor explained.
"'Keeping boarders' in this country goes to
the tune of 'Come Ye Disconsolate!' It's a
doubtful refuge for women who are widows
or would be better off if they were. Where
I live it's a sure thing if well managed&mdash;it's
a good business."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew wore an unconvinced
aspect.</p>

<p>"What do you call 'a good business?'"
she asked.</p>

<p>"The house I have in mind cleared a thousand
a year when it was in right hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
That's not bad, over and above one's board
and lodging. That house is in the market
now. I've just had a letter from a friend
about it. Orella could go out with me, and
step right into Mrs. Annerly's shoes&mdash;she's
just giving up."</p>

<p>"What'd she give up for?" Mrs. Pettigrew
inquired suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;she got married; they all do. There
are three men to one woman in that town,
you see."</p>

<p>"I didn't know there was such a place in
the world&mdash;unless it was a man-of-war," remarked
Susie, looking much interested.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair went on more quietly.</p>

<p>"It's not even a risk, Mrs. Pettigrew.
Rella has a cousin who would gladly run
this house for her. She's admitted that
much. So there's no loss here, and she's got
her home to come back to. I can write to
Dick Hale to nail the proposition at once.
She can go when I go, in about a fortnight,
and I'll guarantee the first year definitely."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't think of letting you do that,
Jane! And if it's as good as you say, there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
no need. But a fortnight! To leave home&mdash;in
a fortnight!"</p>

<p>"What are the difficulties?" the old lady
inquired. "There are always some difficulties."</p>

<p>"You are right, there," agreed the doctor.
"The difficulties in this place are servants.
But just now there's a special chance in that
line. Dick says the best cook in town is
going begging. I'll read you his letter."</p>

<p>She produced it, promptly, from the
breast pocket of her neat coat. Dr. Bellair
wore rather short, tailored skirts of first-class
material; natty, starched blouses&mdash;silk
ones for "dress," and perfectly fitting light
coats. Their color and texture might vary
with the season, but their pockets, never.</p>

<p>"'My dear Jane' (This is my best friend
out there&mdash;a doctor, too. We were in the
same class, both college and medical school.
We fight&mdash;he's a misogynist of the worst
type&mdash;but we're good friends all the same.)
'Why don't you come back? My boys are
lonesome without you, and I am overworked&mdash;you
left so many mishandled invalids for
me to struggle with. Your boarding house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
is going to the dogs. Mrs. Annerly got
worse and worse, failed completely and has
cleared out, with a species of husband, I believe.
The owner has put in a sort of caretaker,
and the roomers get board outside&mdash;it's
better than what they were having.
Moreover, the best cook in town is hunting
a job. Wire me and I'll nail her. You
know the place pays well. Now, why don't
you give up your unnatural attempt to be
a doctor and assume woman's proper
sphere? Come back and keep house!'</p>

<p>"He's a great tease, but he tells the truth.
The house is there, crying to be kept. The
boarders are there&mdash;unfed. Now, Orella
Elder, why don't you wake up and seize the
opportunity?"</p>

<p>Miss Orella was thinking.</p>

<p>"Where's that last letter of Morton's?"</p>

<p>Susie looked for it. Vivian handed it to
her, and Miss Elder read it once more.</p>

<p>"There's plenty of homeless boys out there
besides yours, Orella," the doctor assured
her. "Come on&mdash;and bring both these girls
with you. It's a chance for any girl, Miss
Lane."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>But her friend did not hear her. She
found what she was looking for in the letter
and read it aloud. "I'm on the road again
now, likely to be doing Colorado most of
the year if things go right. It's a fine
country."</p>

<p>Susie hopped up with a little cry.</p>

<p>"Just the thing, Aunt Rella! Let's go
out and surprise Mort. He thinks we are
just built into the ground here. Won't it
be fun, Viva?"</p>

<p>Vivian had risen from her seat and stood
at the window, gazing out with unseeing
eyes at the shadowy little front yard. Morton
might be there. She might see him. But&mdash;was
it womanly to go there&mdash;for that?
There were other reasons, surely. She had
longed for freedom, for a chance to grow, to
do something in life&mdash;something great and
beautiful! Perhaps this was the opening of
the gate, the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>

<p>"You folks are so strong on duty," the
doctor was saying, "Why can't you see a real
duty in this? I tell you, the place is full of
men that need mothering, and sistering&mdash;good
honest sweethearting and marrying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
too. Come on, Rella. Do bigger work than
you've ever done yet&mdash;and, as I said, bring
both these nice girls with you. What do
you say, Miss Lane?"</p>

<p>Vivian turned to her, her fine face flushed
with hope, yet with a small Greek fret on
the broad forehead.</p>

<p>"I'd like to, very much, Dr. Bellair&mdash;on
some accounts. But&mdash;&mdash;" She could not
quite voice her dim objections, her obscure
withdrawals; and so fell back on the excuse
of childhood&mdash;"I'm sure Mother wouldn't
let me."</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair smiled broadly.</p>

<p>"Aren't you over twenty-one?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-five," the girl replied, with
proud acceptance of a life long done&mdash;as one
who owned to ninety-seven.</p>

<p>"And self-supporting?" pursued the doctor.</p>

<p>Vivian flushed.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not yet," she answered; "but I
mean to be."</p>

<p>"Exactly! Now's your chance. Break
away now, my dear, and come West. You
can get work&mdash;start a kindergarten, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
something. I know you love children."</p>

<p>The girl's heart rose within her in a great
throb of hope.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;if I <i>could</i>!" she exclaimed, and even
as she said it, rose half-conscious memories
of the low, sweet tones of Mrs. St. Cloud.
"It is a woman's place to wait&mdash;and to endure."</p>

<p>She heard a step on the walk outside&mdash;looked
out.</p>

<p>"Why, here is Mrs. St. Cloud!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll clear out," said the doctor, as
Susie ran to the door. She was shy, socially.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Jane," said her hostess,
whispering. "Mrs. St. Cloud is no stranger.
She's Mrs. Williams' sister&mdash;been here for
years."</p>

<p>She came in at the word, her head and
shoulders wreathed in a pearl gray shining
veil, her soft long robe held up.</p>

<p>"I saw your light, Miss Elder, and
thought I'd stop in for a moment. Good
evening, Mrs. Pettigrew&mdash;and Miss Susie.
Ah! Vivian!"</p>

<p>"This is my friend, Dr. Bellair&mdash;Mrs. St.
Cloud," Miss Elder was saying. But Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Bellair bowed a little stiffly, not coming forward.</p>

<p>"I've met Mrs. St. Cloud before, I think&mdash;when
she was 'Mrs. James.'"</p>

<p>The lady's face grew sad.</p>

<p>"Ah, you knew my first husband! I lost
him&mdash;many years ago&mdash;typhoid fever."</p>

<p>"I think I heard," said the doctor. And
then, feeling that some expression of sympathy
was called for, she added, "Too bad."</p>

<p>Not all Miss Elder's gentle hospitality,
Mrs. Pettigrew's bright-eyed interest,
Susie's efforts at polite attention, and Vivian's
visible sympathy could compensate
Mrs. St. Cloud for one inimical presence.</p>

<p>"You must have been a mere girl in those
days," she said sweetly. "What a lovely
little town it was&mdash;under the big trees."</p>

<p>"It certainly was," the doctor answered
dryly.</p>

<p>"There is such a fine atmosphere in a college
town, I think," pursued the lady.
"Especially in a co-educational town&mdash;don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>Vivian was a little surprised. She had
had an idea that her admired friend did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
approve of co-education. She must have
been mistaken.</p>

<p>"Such a world of old memories as you call
up, Dr. Bellair," their visitor pursued.
"Those quiet, fruitful days! You remember
Dr. Black's lectures? Of course you do,
better than I. What a fine man he was!
And the beautiful music club we had one
Winter&mdash;and my little private dancing class&mdash;do
you remember that? Such nice boys,
Miss Elder! I used to call them my
acolytes."</p>

<p>Susie gave a little gulp, and coughed to
cover it.</p>

<p>"I guess you'll have to excuse me, ladies,"
said Dr. Bellair. "Good-night." And she
walked upstairs.</p>

<p>Vivian's face flushed and paled and flushed
again. A cold pain was trying to enter
her heart, and she was trying to keep it
out. Her grandmother glanced sharply
from one face to the other.</p>

<p>"Glad to've met you, Mrs. St. Cloud,"
she said, bobbing up with decision. "Good-night,
Rella&mdash;and Susie. Come on child. It's
a wonder your mother hasn't sent after us."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>For once Vivian was glad to go.</p>

<p>"That's a good scheme of Jane Bellair's,
don't you think so?" asked the old lady as
they shut the gate behind them.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;why yes&mdash;I don't see why not."</p>

<p>Vivian was still dizzy with the blow to her
heart's idol. All the soft, still dream-world
she had so labored to keep pure and beautiful
seemed to shake and waver swimmingly.
She could not return to it. The flat white
face of her home loomed before her, square,
hard, hideously unsympathetic&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grandma," said she, stopping that lady
suddenly and laying a pleading hand on her
arm, "Grandma, I believe I'll go."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew nodded decisively.</p>

<p>"I thought you would," she said.</p>

<p>"Do you blame me, Grandma?"</p>

<p>"Not a mite, child. Not a mite. But I'd
sleep on it, if I were you."</p>

<p>And Vivian slept on it&mdash;so far as she
slept at all.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>The days between Vivian's decision
and her departure were harder than
she had foreseen. It took some
courage to make the choice. Had she been
alone, independent, quite free to change,
the move would have been difficult enough;
but to make her plan and hold to it in the
face of a disapproving town, and the definite
opposition of her parents, was a heavy undertaking.</p>

<p>By habit she would have turned to Mrs.
St. Cloud for advice; but between her and
that lady now rose the vague image of a
young boy, dead,&mdash;she could never feel the
same to her again.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Bellair proved a tower of strength.
"My dear girl," she would say to her, patiently,
but with repressed intensity, "do
remember that you are <i>not</i> a child! You are
twenty-five years old. You are a grown
woman, and have as much right to decide for
yourself as a grown man. This isn't wicked&mdash;it
is a wise move; a practical one. Do you
want to grow up like the rest of the useless
single women in this little social cemetery?"</p>

<p>Her mother took it very hard. "I don't
see how you can think of leaving us. We're
getting old now&mdash;and here's Grandma to
take care of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Huh!" said that lady, with such marked
emphasis that Mrs. Lane hastily changed
the phrase to "I mean to <i>be with</i>&mdash;you do
like to have Vivian with you, you can't deny
that, Mother."</p>

<p>"But Mama," said the girl, "you are not
old; you are only forty-three. I am sorry
to leave you&mdash;I am really; but it isn't forever!
I can come back. And you don't
really need me. Sarah runs the house exactly
as you like; you don't depend on me
for a thing, and never did. As to Grandma!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>"&mdash;and
she looked affectionately at the old
lady&mdash;"she don't need me nor anybody else.
She's independent if ever anybody was. She
won't miss me a mite&mdash;will you Grandma?"
Mrs. Pettigrew looked at her for a moment,
the corners of her mouth tucked in tightly.
"No," she said, "I shan't miss you a mite!"</p>

<p>Vivian was a little grieved at the prompt
acquiescence. She felt nearer to her grandmother
in many ways than to either parent.
"Well, I'll miss you!" said she, going to her
and kissing her smooth pale cheek, "I'll miss
you awfully!"</p>

<p>Mr. Lane expressed his disapproval most
thoroughly, and more than once; then retired
into gloomy silence, alternated with
violent dissuasion; but since a woman of
twenty-five is certainly free to choose her
way of life, and there was no real objection
to this change, except that it <i>was</i> a change,
and therefore dreaded, his opposition,
though unpleasant, was not prohibitive.
Vivian's independent fortune of $87.50, the
savings of many years, made the step possible,
even without his assistance.</p>

<p>There were two weeks of exceeding dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>agreeableness
in the household, but Vivian
kept her temper and her determination under
a rain of tears, a hail of criticism, and heavy
wind of argument and exhortation. All her
friends and neighbors, and many who were
neither, joined in the effort to dissuade her;
but she stood firm as the martyrs of old.</p>

<p>Heredity plays strange tricks with us.
Somewhere under the girl's dumb gentleness
and patience lay a store of quiet strength
from some Pilgrim Father or Mother.
Never before had she set her will against
her parents; conscience had always told her
to submit. Now conscience told her to rebel,
and she did. She made her personal arrangements,
said goodbye to her friends, declined
to discuss with anyone, was sweet and
quiet and kind at home, and finally appeared
at the appointed hour on the platform of
the little station.</p>

<p>Numbers of curious neighbors were there
to see them off, all who knew them and could
spare the time seemed to be on hand. Vivian's
mother came, but her father did not.</p>

<p>At the last moment, just as the train drew
in, Grandma appeared, serene and brisk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
descending, with an impressive amount of
hand baggage, from "the hack."</p>

<p>"Goodbye, Laura," she said. "I think
these girls need a chaperon. I'm going too."</p>

<p>So blasting was the astonishment caused
by this proclamation, and so short a time
remained to express it, that they presently
found themselves gliding off in the big Pullman,
all staring at one another in silent
amazement.</p>

<p>"I hate discussion," said Mrs. Pettigrew.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>None of these ladies were used to traveling,
save Dr. Bellair, who had made the
cross continent trip often enough to think
nothing of it.</p>

<p>The unaccustomed travelers found much
excitement in the journey. As women, embarking
on a new, and, in the eyes of their
friends, highly doubtful enterprise, they
had emotion to spare; and to be confronted
at the outset by a totally unexpected grandmother
was too much for immediate comprehension.</p>

<p>She looked from one to the other, sparkling,
triumphant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"I made up my mind, same as you did,
hearing Jane Bellair talk," she explained.
"Sounded like good sense. I always wanted
to travel, always, and never had the opportunity.
This was a real good chance." Her
mouth shut, tightened, widened, drew into
a crinkly delighted smile.</p>

<p>They sat still staring at her.</p>

<p>"You needn't look at me like that! I
guess it's a free country! I bought my ticket&mdash;sent
for it same as you did. And I didn't
have to ask <i>anybody</i>&mdash;I'm no daughter.
My duty, as far as I know it, is <i>done</i>! This
is a pleasure trip!"</p>

<p>She was triumph incarnate.</p>

<p>"And you never said a word!" This from
Vivian.</p>

<p>"Not a word. Saved lots of trouble.
Take care of me indeed! Laura needn't
think I'm dependent on her <i>yet</i>!"</p>

<p>Vivian's heart rather yearned over her
mother, thus doubly bereft.</p>

<p>"The truth is," her grandmother went on,
"Samuel wants to go to Florida the worst
way; I heard 'em talking about it! He
wasn't willing to go alone&mdash;not he! Wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
somebody to hear him cough, I say! And
Laura couldn't go&mdash;'Mother was so dependent'&mdash;<i>Huh!</i>"</p>

<p>Vivian began to smile. She knew this
had been talked over, and given up on that
account. She herself could have been easily
disposed of, but Mrs. Lane chose to think
her mother a lifelong charge.</p>

<p>"Act as if I was ninety!" the old lady
burst forth again. "I'll show 'em!"</p>

<p>"I think you're dead right, Mrs. Pettigrew,"
said Dr. Bellair. "Sixty isn't anything.
You ought to have twenty years of
enjoyable life yet, before they call you 'old'&mdash;maybe
more."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew cocked an eye at her.
"My grandmother lived to be a hundred and
four," said she, "and kept on working up to
the last year. I don't know about enjoyin'
life, but she was useful for pretty near a
solid century. After she broke her hip the
last time she sat still and sewed and knitted.
After her eyes gave out she took to hooking
rugs."</p>

<p>"I hope it will be forty years, Mrs. Pettigrew,"
said Sue, "and I'm real glad you're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
coming. It'll make it more like home."</p>

<p>Miss Elder was a little slow in accommodating
herself to this new accession. She
liked Mrs. Pettigrew very much&mdash;but&mdash;a
grandmother thus airily at large seemed to
unsettle the foundations of things. She was
polite, even cordial, but evidently found it
difficult to accept the facts.</p>

<p>"Besides," said Mrs. Pettigrew, "you may
not get all those boarders at once and I'll
be one to count on. I stopped at the bank
this morning and had 'em arrange for my
account out in Carston. They were some
surprised, but there was no time to ask
questions!" She relapsed into silence and
gazed with keen interest at the whirling
landscape.</p>

<p>Throughout the journey she proved the
best of travelers; was never car-sick, slept
well in the joggling berth, enjoyed the food,
and continually astonished them by producing
from her handbag the most diverse and
unlooked for conveniences. An old-fashioned
traveller had forgotten her watchkey&mdash;Grandma
produced an automatic one warranted
to fit anything. "Takes up mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
little room&mdash;and I thought maybe it would
come in handy," she said.</p>

<p>She had a small bottle of liquid court-plaster,
and plenty of the solid kind. She
had a delectable lotion for the hands, a real
treasure on the dusty journey; also a tiny
corkscrew, a strong pair of "pinchers," sewing
materials, playing cards, string, safety-pins,
elastic bands, lime drops, stamped envelopes,
smelling salts, troches, needles and
thread.</p>

<p>"Did you bring a trunk, Grandma?"
asked Vivian.</p>

<p>"Two," said Grandma, "excess baggage.
All paid for and checked."</p>

<p>"How did you ever learn to arrange
things so well?" Sue asked admiringly.</p>

<p>"Read about it," the old lady answered.
"There's no end of directions nowadays.
I've been studying up."</p>

<p>She was so gleeful and triumphant, so
variously useful, so steadily gay and stimulating,
that they all grew to value her presence
long before they reached Carston; but
they had no conception of the ultimate ef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>fect
of a resident grandmother in that new
and bustling town.</p>

<p>To Vivian the journey was a daily and
nightly revelation. She had read much but
traveled very little, never at night. The
spreading beauty of the land was to her a
new stimulus; she watched by the hour the
endless panorama fly past her window, its
countless shades of green, the brown and
red soil, the fleeting dashes of color where
wild flowers gathered thickly. She was repeatedly
impressed by seeing suddenly beside
her the name of some town which had
only existed in her mind as "capital city"
associated with "principal exports" and
"bounded on the north."</p>

<p>At night, sleeping little, she would raise
her curtain and look out, sideways, at the
stars. Big shadowy trees ran by, steep cuttings
rose like a wall of darkness, and the
hilly curves of open country rose and fell
against the sky line like a shaken carpet.</p>

<p>She faced the long, bright vistas of the
car and studied people's faces&mdash;such different
people from any she had seen before.
A heavy young man with small, light eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
sat near by, and cast frequent glances at
both the girls, going by their seat at intervals.
Vivian considered this distinctly rude,
and Sue did not like his looks, so he got
nothing for his pains, yet even this added
color to the day.</p>

<p>The strange, new sense of freedom grew
in her heart, a feeling of lightness and hope
and unfolding purpose.</p>

<p>There was continued discussion as to what
the girls should do.</p>

<p>"We can be waitresses for Auntie till we
get something else," Sue practically insisted.
"The doctor says it will be hard to get good
service and I'm sure the boarders would
like us."</p>

<p>"You can both find work if you want it.
What do you want to do, Vivian?" asked
Dr. Bellair, not for the first time.</p>

<p>Vivian was still uncertain.</p>

<p>"I love children best," she said. "I could
teach&mdash;but I haven't a certificate. I'd <i>love</i>
a kindergarten; I've studied that&mdash;at
home."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder if you could get up a
kindergarten right off," the doctor assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
her. "Meantime, as this kitten says, you
could help Miss Elder out and turn an honest
penny while you're waiting."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it&mdash;interfere with my teaching
later?" the girl inquired.</p>

<p>"Not a bit, not a bit. We're not so foolish
out here. We'll fix you up all right in
no time."</p>

<p>It was morning when they arrived at last
and came out of the cindery, noisy crowded
cars into the wide, clean, brilliant stillness
of the high plateau. They drew deep
breaths; the doctor squared her shoulders
with a glad, homecoming smile. Vivian
lifted her head and faced the new surroundings
as an unknown world. Grandma gazed
all ways, still cheerful, and their baggage
accrued about them as a rampart.</p>

<p>A big bearded man, carelessly dressed,
whirled up in a dusty runabout, and stepped
out smiling. He seized Dr. Bellair by both
hands, and shook them warmly.</p>

<p>"Thought I'd catch you, Johnny," he said.
"Glad to see you back. If you've got the
landlady, I've got the cook!"</p>

<p>"Here we are," said she. "Miss Orella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Elder&mdash;Dr. Hale; Mrs. Pettigrew, Miss
Susie Elder, Miss Lane&mdash;Dr. Richard
Hale."</p>

<p>He bowed deeply to Mrs. Pettigrew,
shook hands with Miss Orella, and addressed
himself to her, giving only a cold
nod to the two girls, and quite turning away
from them.</p>

<p>Susie, in quiet aside to Vivian, made unfavorable
comment.</p>

<p>"This is your Western chivalry, is it?"
she said. "Even Bainville does better than
that."</p>

<p>"I don't know why we should mind,"
Vivian answered. "It's Dr. Bellair's friend;
he don't care anything about us."</p>

<p>But she was rather of Sue's opinion.</p>

<p>The big man took Dr. Bellair in his car,
and they followed in a station carriage,
eagerly observing their new surroundings,
and surprised, as most Easterners are, by
the broad beauty of the streets and the
modern conveniences everywhere&mdash;electric
cars, electric lights, telephones, soda fountains,
where they had rather expected to find
tents and wigwams.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>The house, when they were all safely
within it, turned out to be "just like a real
house," as Sue said; and proved even more
attractive than the doctor had described it.
It was a big, rambling thing, at home they
would have called it a hotel, with its neat
little sign, "The Cottonwoods," and Vivian
finally concluded that it looked like a seaside
boarding house, built for the purpose.</p>

<p>A broad piazza ran all across the front, the
door opening into a big square hall, a sort
of general sitting-room; on either side were
four good rooms, opening on a transverse
passage. The long dining-room and kitchen
were in the rear of the hall.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair had two, her office fronting
on the side street, with a bedroom behind it.
They gave Mrs. Pettigrew the front corner
room on that side and kept the one opening
from the hall as their own parlor. In the
opposite wing was Miss Elder's room next
the hall, and the girls in the outer back corner,
while the two front ones on that side
were kept for the most impressive and high-priced
boarders.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew regarded her apartments
with suspicion as being too "easy."</p>

<p>"I don't mind stairs," she said. "Dr. Bellair
has to be next her office&mdash;but why do I
have to be next Dr. Bellair?"</p>

<p>It was represented to her that she would
be nearer to everything that went on and
she agreed without more words.</p>

<p>Dr. Hale exhibited the house as if he
owned it.</p>

<p>"The agent's out of town," he said, "and
we don't need him anyway. He said he'd
do anything you wanted, in reason."</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair watched with keen interest
the effect of her somewhat daring description,
as Miss Orella stepped from room to
room examining everything with a careful
eye, with an expression of growing generalship.
Sue fluttered about delightedly, discovering
advantages everywhere and making
occasional disrespectful remarks to Vivian
about Dr. Hale's clothes.</p>

<p>"Looks as if he never saw a clothes
brush!" she said. "A finger out on his glove,
a button off his coat. No need to tell us
there's no woman in his house!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>"You can decide about your cook when
you've tried her," he said to Miss Elder. "I
engaged her for a week&mdash;on trial. She's in
the kitchen now, and will have your dinner
ready presently. I think you'll like her,
if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good boy!" said Dr. Bellair. "Sometimes
you show as much sense as a woman&mdash;almost."</p>

<p>"What's the 'if'" asked Miss Orella,
looking worried.</p>

<p>"Question of character," he answered.
"She's about forty-five, with a boy of sixteen
or so. He's not over bright, but a willing
worker. She's a good woman&mdash;from
one standpoint. She won't leave that boy
nor give him up to strangers; but she has
a past!"</p>

<p>"What is her present?" Dr. Bellair asked,
"that's the main thing."</p>

<p>Dr. Hale clapped her approvingly on the
shoulder, but looked doubtingly toward
Miss Orella.</p>

<p>"And what's her future if somebody don't
help her?" Vivian urged.</p>

<p>"Can she cook?" asked Grandma.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>"Is she a safe person to have in the
house?" inquired Dr. Bellair meaningly.</p>

<p>"She can cook," he replied. "She's French,
or of French parentage. She used to keep
a little&mdash;place of entertainment. The food
was excellent. She's been a patient of mine&mdash;off
and on&mdash;for five years&mdash;and I should
call her perfectly safe."</p>

<p>Miss Orella still looked worried. "I'd
like to help her and the boy, but would it&mdash;look
well? I don't want to be mean about
it, but this is a very serious venture with us,
Dr. Hale, and I have these girls with me."</p>

<p>"With you and Dr. Bellair and Mrs. Pettigrew
the young ladies will be quite safe,
Miss Elder. As to the woman's present
character, she has suffered two changes of
heart, she's become a religious devotee&mdash;and
a man-hater! And from a business
point of view, I assure you that if Jeanne
Jeaune is in your kitchen you'll never have
a room empty."</p>

<p>"Johnny Jones! queer name for a woman!"
said Grandma. They repeated it to
her carefully, but she only changed to "Jennie
June," and adhered to one or the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
thereafter. "What's the boy's name?" she
asked further.</p>

<p>"Theophile," Dr. Hale replied.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said she.</p>

<p>"Why don't she keep an eating-house
still?" asked Dr. Bellair rather suspiciously.</p>

<p>"That's what I like best about her," he
answered. "She is trying to break altogether
with her past. She wants to give up 'public
life'&mdash;and private life won't have her."</p>

<p>They decided to try the experiment, and
found it worked well.</p>

<p>There were two bedrooms over the kitchen
where "Mrs. Jones" as Grandma generally
called her, and her boy, could be quite comfortable
and by themselves; and although of
a somewhat sour and unsociable aspect, and
fiercely watchful lest anyone offend her son,
this questionable character proved an unquestionable
advantage. With the boy's
help, she cooked for the houseful, which
grew to be a family of twenty-five. He also
wiped dishes, helped in the laundry work,
cleaned and scrubbed and carried coal; and
Miss Elder, seeing his steady usefulness, insisted
on paying wages for him too. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
unlooked for praise and gain won the
mother's heart, and as she grew more at
home with them, and he less timid, she encouraged
him to do the heavier cleaning in
the rest of the house.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Grandma. "I wish more
sane and moral persons would work like
that!"</p>

<p>Vivian watched with amazement the swift
filling of the house.</p>

<p>There was no trouble at all about boarders,
except in discriminating among them.
"Make them pay in advance, Rella," Dr.
Bellair advised, "it doesn't cost them any
more, and it is a great convenience. 'References
exchanged,' of course. There are a
good many here that I know&mdash;you can always
count on Mr. Dykeman and Fordham
Grier, and John Unwin."</p>

<p>Before a month was over the place was
full to its limits with what Sue called "assorted
boarders," the work ran smoothly
and the business end of Miss Elder's venture
seemed quite safe. They had the twenty
Dr. Bellair prophesied, and except for her,
Mrs. Pettigrew, Miss Peeder, a teacher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
dancing and music; Mrs. Jocelyn, who was
interested in mining, and Sarah Hart, who
described herself as a "journalist," all were
men.</p>

<p>Fifteen men to eight women. Miss Elder
sat at the head of her table, looked down it
and across the other one, and marvelled continuously.
Never in her New England life
had she been with so many men&mdash;except in
church&mdash;and they were more scattered.
This houseful of heavy feet and broad
shoulders, these deep voices and loud laughs,
the atmosphere of interchanging jests and
tobacco smoke, was new to her. She hated
the tobacco smoke, but that could not be
helped. They did not smoke in her parlor,
but the house was full of it none the less, in
which constant presence she began to reverse
the Irishman's well known judgment
of whiskey, allowing that while all tobacco
was bad, some tobacco was much worse than
others.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>To Vivian the new life offered a stimulus,
a sense of stir and promise even
beyond her expectations. She wrote
dutiful letters to her mother, trying to describe
the difference between this mountain
town and Bainville, but found the New England
viewpoint an insurmountable obstacle.</p>

<p>To Bainville "Out West" was a large
blank space on the map, and the blank space
in the mind which matched it was but
sparsely dotted with a few disconnected ideas
such as "cowboy," "blizzard," "prairie fire,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
"tornado," "border ruffian," and the like.</p>

<p>The girl's painstaking description of the
spreading, vigorous young town, with its
fine, modern buildings, its banks and stores
and theatres, its country club and parks, its
pleasant social life, made small impression
on the Bainville mind. But the fact that
Miss Elder's venture was successful from
the first did impress old acquaintances, and
Mrs. Lane read aloud to selected visitors
her daughter's accounts of their new and
agreeable friends. Nothing was said of
"chaps," "sombreros," or "shooting up the
town," however, and therein a distinct sense
of loss was felt.</p>

<p>Much of what was passing in Vivian's
mind she could not make clear to her mother
had she wished to. The daily presence and
very friendly advances of so many men,
mostly young and all polite (with the exception
of Dr. Hale, whose indifference was
almost rude by contrast), gave a new life
and color to the days.</p>

<p>She could not help giving some thought
to this varied assortment, and the carefully
preserved image of Morton, already nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
years dim, waxed dimmer. But she had a
vague consciousness of being untrue to her
ideals, or to Mrs. St. Cloud's ideals, now
somewhat discredited, and did not readily
give herself up to the cheerful attractiveness
of the position.</p>

<p>Susie found no such difficulty. Her ideals
were simple, and while quite within the
bounds of decorum, left her plenty of room
for amusement. So popular did she become,
so constantly in demand for rides and walks
and oft-recurring dances, that Vivian felt
called upon to give elder sisterly advice.</p>

<p>But Miss Susan scouted her admonitions.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I have a good time?" she
said. "Think how we grew up! Half a
dozen boys to twenty girls, and when there
was anything to go to&mdash;the lordly way
they'd pick and choose! And after all our
efforts and machinations most of us had to
dance with each other. And the quarrels
we had! Here they stand around three deep
asking for dances&mdash;and <i>they</i> have to dance
with each other, and <i>they</i> do the quarreling.
I've heard 'em." And Sue giggled delightedly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>"There's no reason we shouldn't enjoy
ourselves, Susie, of course, but aren't you&mdash;rather
hard on them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" Sue protested. "Dr. Bellair
said I should get married out here! She
says the same old thing&mdash;that it's 'a woman's
duty,' and I propose to do it. That is&mdash;they'll
propose, and I won't do it! Not till
I make up my mind. Now see how you like
this!"</p>

<p>She had taken a fine large block of "legal
cap" and set down their fifteen men thereon,
with casual comment.</p>

<p>1. Mr. Unwin&mdash;Too old, big, quiet.</p>

<p>2. Mr. Elmer Skee&mdash;Big, too old, funny.</p>

<p>3. Jimmy Saunders&mdash;Middle-sized, amusing,
nice.</p>

<p>4. P. R. Gibbs&mdash;Too little, too thin, too
cocky.</p>

<p>5. George Waterson&mdash;Middling, pretty
nice.</p>

<p>6. J. J. Cuthbert&mdash;Big, horrid.</p>

<p>7. Fordham Greer&mdash;Big, pleasant.</p>

<p>8. W. S. Horton&mdash;Nothing much.</p>

<p>9. A. L. Dykeman&mdash;Interesting, too old.</p>

<p>10. Professor Toomey&mdash;Little, horrid.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>11. Arthur Fitzwilliam&mdash;Ridiculous, too
young.</p>

<p>12. Howard Winchester&mdash;Too nice, distrust him.</p>

<p>13. Lawson W. Briggs&mdash;Nothing much.</p>

<p>14. Edward S. Jenks&mdash;Fair to middling.</p>

<p>15. Mr. A. Smith&mdash;Minus.</p>

<p>She held it up in triumph. "I got 'em all
out of the book&mdash;quite correct. Now,
which'll you have."</p>

<p>"Susie Elder! You little goose! Do you
imagine that all these fifteen men are going
to propose to you?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I hope so!" said the cheerful
damsel. "We've only been settled a fortnight
and one of 'em has already!"</p>

<p>Vivian was impressed at once. "Which?&mdash;You
don't mean it!"</p>

<p>Sue pointed to the one marked "minus."</p>

<p>"It was only 'A. Smith.' I never should
be willing to belong to 'A. Smith,' it's too
indefinite&mdash;unless it was a last resort.
Several more are&mdash;well, extremely friendly!
Now don't look so severe. You needn't
worry about me. I'm not quite so foolish as
I talk, you know."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>She was not. Her words were light and
saucy, but she was as demure and decorous
a little New Englander as need be desired;
and she could not help it if the hearts of
the unattached young men of whom the
town was full, warmed towards her.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair astonished them at lunch one
day in their first week.</p>

<p>"Dick Hale wants us all to come over to
tea this afternoon," she said, as if it was
the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>"Tea? Where?" asked Mrs. Pettigrew
sharply.</p>

<p>"At his house. He has 'a home of his
own,' you know. And he particularly wants
you, Mrs. Pettigrew&mdash;and Miss Elder&mdash;the
girls, of course."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't care to go," Vivian remarked
with serene indifference, but Susie
did.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, Vivian! It'll be so funny!
A man's home!&mdash;and we may never get
another chance. He's such a bear!"</p>

<p>Dr. Hale's big house was only across the
road from theirs, standing in a large lot with
bushes and trees about it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>"He's been here nine years," Dr. Bellair
told them. "That's an old inhabitant for
us. He boarded in that house for a while;
then it was for sale and he bought it. He
built that little office of his at the corner&mdash;says
he doesn't like to live where he works,
or work where he lives. He took his meals
over here for a while&mdash;and then set up for
himself."</p>

<p>"I should think he'd be lonely," Miss Elder
suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh, he has his boys, you know&mdash;always
three or four young fellows about him. It's
a mighty good thing for them, too."</p>

<p>Dr. Hale's home proved a genuine surprise.
They had regarded it as a big, neglected-looking
place, and found on entering
the gate that the inside view of that
rampant shrubbery was extremely pleasant.
Though not close cut and swept of leaves
and twigs, it still was beautiful; and the
tennis court and tether-ball ring showed the
ground well used.</p>

<p>Grandma looked about her with a keen
interrogative eye, and was much impressed,
as, indeed, were they all. She voiced their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
feelings justly when, the true inwardness
of this pleasant home bursting fully upon
them, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, of all things! A man keeping
house!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Dr. Hale with his dry
smile. "Is there any deficiency, mental or
physical, about a man, to prevent his attempting
this abstruse art?"</p>

<p>She looked at him sharply. "I don't know
about deficiency, but there seems to be
somethin' about 'em that keeps 'em out of
the business. I guess it's because women are
so cheap."</p>

<p>"No doubt you are right, Mrs. Pettigrew.
And here women are scarce and high. Hence
my poor efforts."</p>

<p>His poor efforts had bought or built a
roomy pleasant house, and furnished it with
a solid comfort and calm attractiveness that
was most satisfying. Two Chinamen did
the work; cooking, cleaning, washing, waiting
on table, with silent efficiency. "They
are as steady as eight-day clocks," said Dr.
Hale. "I pay them good wages and they
are worth it."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>"Sun here had to go home once&mdash;to be
married, also, to see his honored parents, I
believe, and to leave a grand-'Sun' to attend
to the ancestors; but he brought in another
Chink first and trained him so well that I
hardly noticed the difference. Came back
in a year or so, and resumed his place without
a jar."</p>

<p>Miss Elder watched with fascinated eyes
these soft-footed servants with clean, white
garments and shiny coils of long, braided
hair.</p>

<p>"I may have to come to it," she admitted,
"but&mdash;dear me, it doesn't seem natural to
have a man doing housework!"</p>

<p>Dr. Hale smiled again. "You don't want
men to escape from dependence, I see. Perhaps,
if more men knew how comfortably
they could live without women, the world
would be happier." There was a faint wire-edge
to his tone, in spite of the courteous
expression, but Miss Elder did not notice
it and if Mrs. Pettigrew did, she made no
comment.</p>

<p>They noted the varied excellences of his
housekeeping with high approval.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>"You certainly know how, Dr. Hale,"
said Miss Orella; "I particularly admire
these beds&mdash;with the sheets buttoned down,
German fashion, isn't it? What made you
do that?"</p>

<p>"I've slept so much in hotels," he answered;
"and found the sheets always inadequate
to cover the blankets&mdash;and the
marks of other men's whiskers! I don't like
blankets in my neck. Besides it saves washing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew nodded vehemently.
"You have sense," she said.</p>

<p>The labor-saving devices were a real
surprise to them. A "chute" for soiled clothing
shot from the bathroom on each floor to
the laundry in the basement; a dumbwaiter
of construction large and strong enough to
carry trunks, went from cellar to roof; the
fireplaces dropped their ashes down mysterious
inner holes; and for the big one in the
living-room a special "lift" raised a box of
wood up to the floor level, hidden by one of
the "settles."</p>

<p>"Saves work&mdash;saves dirt&mdash;saves expense,"
said Dr. Hale.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Hale and her niece secretly thought
the rooms rather bare, but Dr. Bellair was
highly in favor of that very feature.</p>

<p>"You see Dick don't believe in jimcracks
and dirt-catchers, and he likes sunlight.
Books all under glass&mdash;no curtains to wash
and darn and fuss with&mdash;none of those fancy
pincushions and embroidered thingummies&mdash;I
quite envy him."</p>

<p>"Why don't you have one yourself,
Johnny?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Because I don't like housekeeping," she
said, "and you do. Masculine instinct, I
suppose!"</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Mrs. Pettigrew with her
sudden one-syllable chuckle.</p>

<p>The girls followed from room to room,
scarce noticing these comments, or the eager
politeness of the four pleasant-faced young
fellows who formed the doctor's present family.
She could not but note the intelligent
efficiency of the place, but felt more deeply
the underlying spirit, the big-brotherly kindness
which prompted his hospitable care of
these nice boys. It was delightful to hear
them praise him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>"O, he's simply great," whispered Archie
Burns, a ruddy-cheeked young Scotchman.
"He pretends there's nothing to it&mdash;that he
wants company&mdash;that we pay for all we get&mdash;and
that sort of thing, you know; but this
is no boarding house, I can tell you!" And
then he flushed till his very hair grew redder&mdash;remembering
that the guests came from
one.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" Vivian cordially agreed
with him. "You must have lovely times here.
I don't wonder you appreciate it!" and she
smiled so sweetly that he felt at ease again.</p>

<p>Beneath all this cheery good will and the
gay chatter of the group her quick sense
caught an impression of something hidden
and repressed. She felt the large and quiet
beauty of the rooms; the smooth comfort,
the rational, pleasant life; but still more she
felt a deep keynote of loneliness.</p>

<p>The pictures told her most. She noted
one after another with inward comment.</p>

<p>"There's 'Persepolis,'" she said to herself&mdash;"loneliness
incarnate; and that other lion-and-ruin
thing,&mdash;loneliness and decay. Gerome's
'Lion in the Desert,' too, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
thing. Then Daniel&mdash;more lions, more loneliness,
but power. 'Circe and the Companions
of Ulysses'&mdash;cruel, but loneliness and
power again&mdash;of a sort. There's that 'Island
of Death' too&mdash;a beautiful thing&mdash;but O
dear!&mdash;And young Burne-Jones' 'Vampire'
was in one of the bedrooms&mdash;that one
he shut the door of!"</p>

<p>While they ate and drank in the long,
low-ceiled wide-windowed room below, she
sought the bookcases and looked them over
curiously. Yes&mdash;there was Marcus Aurelius,
Epictetus, Plato, Emerson and Carlisle&mdash;the
great German philosophers, the
French, the English&mdash;all showing signs of
use.</p>

<p>Dr. Hale observed her inspection. It
seemed to vaguely annoy him, as if someone
were asking too presuming questions.</p>

<p>"Interested in philosophy, Miss Lane?"
he asked, drily, coming toward her.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;so far as I understand it," she answered.</p>

<p>"And how far does that go?"</p>

<p>She felt the inference, and raised her soft
eyes to his rather reproachfully.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>"Not far, I am afraid. But I do know
that these books teach one how to bear
trouble."</p>

<p>He met her gaze steadily, but something
seemed to shut, deep in his eyes. They
looked as unassailable as a steel safe. He
straightened his big shoulders with a defiant
shrug, and returned to sit by Mrs. Pettigrew,
to whom he made himself most agreeable.</p>

<p>The four young men did the honors of
the tea table, with devotion to all; and some
especially intended for the younger ladies.
Miss Elder cried out in delight at the
tea.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it, Dr. Hale? Can
it be had here?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not. That is a particular
brand. Sun brought me a chest of it when
he came from his visit."</p>

<p>When they went home each lady was
given a present, Chinese fashion&mdash;lychee
nuts for Sue, lily-bulbs for Vivian, a large
fan for Mrs. Pettigrew, and a package of
the wonderful tea for Miss Orella.</p>

<p>"That's a splendid thing for him to do,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
she said, as they walked back. "Such a safe
place for those boys!"</p>

<p>"It's lovely of him," Sue agreed. "I don't
care if he is a woman-hater."</p>

<p>Vivian said nothing, but admitted, on
being questioned, that "he was very interesting."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew was delighted with their
visit. "I like this country," she declared.
"Things are different. A man couldn't do
that in Bainville&mdash;he'd be talked out of
town."</p>

<p>That night she sought Dr. Bellair and
questioned her.</p>

<p>"Tell me about that man," she demanded.
"How old is he?"</p>

<p>"Not as old as he looks by ten years,"
said the doctor. "No, I can't tell you why
his hair's gray."</p>

<p>"What woman upset him?" asked the old
lady.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair regarded her thoughtfully.
"He has made me no confidences, Mrs. Pettigrew,
but I think you are right. It must
have been a severe shock&mdash;for he is very
bitter against women. It is a shame, too, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
he is one of the best of men. He prefers
men patients&mdash;and gets them. The women
he will treat if he must, but he is kindest
to the 'fallen' ones, and inclined to
sneer at the rest. And yet he's the
straightest man I ever knew. I'm thankful
to have him come here so much. He
needs it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew marched off, nodding
sagely. She felt a large and growing interest
in her new surroundings, more especially
in the numerous boys, but was somewhat
amazed at her popularity among them.
These young men were mainly exiles from
home; the older ones, though more settled
perhaps, had been even longer away from
their early surroundings; and a real live
Grandma, as Jimmy Saunders said, was an
"attraction."</p>

<p>"If you were mine," he told her laughingly,
"I'd get a pianist and some sort of
little side show, and exhibit you all up and
down the mountains!&mdash;for good money.
Why some of the boys never had a
Grandma, and those that did haven't seen
one since they were kids!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>"Very complimentary, I'm sure&mdash;but impracticable,"
said the old lady.</p>

<p>The young men came to her with confidences,
they asked her advice, they kept her
amused with tales of their adventures;
some true, some greatly diversified; and she
listened with a shrewd little smile and a wag
of the head&mdash;so they never were quite sure
whether they were "fooling" Grandma or
not.</p>

<p>To her, as a general confidant, came Miss
Peeder with a tale of woe. The little hall
that she rented for her dancing classes had
burned down on a windy Sunday, and there
was no other suitable and within her means.</p>

<p>"There's Sloan's; but it's over a barroom&mdash;it's
really not possible. And Baker's is
too expensive. The church rooms they won't
let for dancing&mdash;I don't know what I <i>am</i> to
do, Mrs. Pettigrew!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask Orella Elder to rent
you her dining-room&mdash;it's big enough. They
could move the tables&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Peeder's eyes opened in hopeful surprise.
"Oh, if she <i>would</i>! Do <i>you</i> think
she would? It would be ideal."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Elder being called upon, was quite
fluttered by the proposition, and consulted
Dr. Bellair.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said that lady. "Dancing is
first rate exercise&mdash;good for us all. Might
as well have the girls dance here under your
eye as going out all the time&mdash;and it's some
addition to the income. They'll pay extra
for refreshments, too. I'd do it."</p>

<p>With considerable trepidation Miss Orella
consented, and their first "class night" was
awaited by her in a state of suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>To have music and dancing&mdash;"with refreshments"&mdash;twice
a week&mdash;in her own
house&mdash;this seemed to her like a career of
furious dissipation.</p>

<p>Vivian, though with a subtle sense of
withdrawal from a too general intimacy, was
inwardly rather pleased; and Susie bubbled
over with delight.</p>

<p>"Oh what fun!" she cried. "I never had
enough dancing! I don't believe anybody
has!"</p>

<p>"We don't belong to the Class, you
know," Vivian reminded her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh yes! Miss Peeder says we must <i>all</i>
come&mdash;that she would feel <i>very</i> badly if we
didn't; and the boarders have all joined&mdash;to
a man!"</p>

<p>Everyone seemed pleased except Mrs.
Jeaune. Dancing she considered immoral;
music, almost as much so&mdash;and Miss Elder
trembled lest she lose her. But the offer of
extra payments for herself and son on these
two nights each week proved sufficient to
quell her scruples.</p>

<p>Theophile doubled up the tables, set chairs
around the walls, waxed the floor, and was
then sent to bed and locked in by his anxious
mother.</p>

<p>She labored, during the earlier hours of
the evening, in the preparation of sandwiches
and coffee, cake and lemonade&mdash;which
viands were later shoved through the
slide by the austere cook, and distributed as
from a counter by Miss Peeder's assistant.
Mrs. Jeaune would come no nearer, but
peered darkly upon them through the peep-hole
in the swinging door.</p>

<p>It was a very large room, due to the time
when many "mealers" had been accommo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>dated.
There were windows on each side,
windows possessing the unusual merit of
opening from the top; wide double doors
made the big front hall a sort of anteroom,
and the stairs and piazza furnished opportunities
for occasional couples who felt the
wish for retirement. In the right-angled
passages, long hat-racks on either side were
hung with "Derbies," "Kossuths" and "Stetsons,"
and the ladies took off their wraps,
and added finishing touches to their toilettes
in Miss Elder's room.</p>

<p>The house was full of stir and bustle, of
pretty dresses, of giggles and whispers, and
the subdued exchange of comments among
the gentlemen. The men predominated, so
that there was no lack of partners for any
of the ladies.</p>

<p>Miss Orella accepted her new position
with a half-terrified enjoyment. Not in
many years had she found herself so in demand.
Her always neat and appropriate
costume had blossomed suddenly for the
occasion; her hair, arranged by the affectionate
and admiring Susie, seemed softer
and more voluminous. Her eyes grew bril<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>liant,
and the delicate color in her face
warmed and deepened.</p>

<p>Miss Peeder had installed a pianola to
cover emergencies, but on this opening evening
she had both piano and violin&mdash;good,
lively, sole-stirring music. Everyone was
on the floor, save a few gentlemen who evidently
wished they were.</p>

<p>Sue danced with the gaiety and lightness
of a kitten among wind-blown leaves, Vivian
with gliding grace, smooth and harmonious,
Miss Orella with skill and evident enjoyment,
though still conscientious in every accurate
step.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Pettigrew appeared, sedately
glorious in black silk, jet-beaded, and
with much fine old lace. She bore in front
of her a small wicker rocking chair, and
headed for a corner near the door. Her
burden was promptly taken from her by one
of the latest comers, a tall person with a
most devoted manner.</p>

<p>"Allow <i>me</i>, ma'am," he said, and placed
the little chair at the point she indicated.
"No lady ought to rustle for rockin' chairs
with so many gentlemen present."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>He was a man of somewhat advanced age,
but his hair was still more black than white
and had a curly, wiggish effect save as its
indigenous character was proven by three
small bare patches of a conspicuous nature.</p>

<p>He bowed so low before her that she could
not help observing these distinctions, and
then answered her startled look before she
had time to question him.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," he explained, passing his hand
over head; "scalped three several times and
left for dead. But I'm here yet. Mr. Elmer
Skee, at your service."</p>

<p>"I thought when an Indian scalped you
there wasn't enough hair left to make
Greeley whiskers," said Grandma, rising to
the occasion.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, ma'am, they ain't so efficacious
as all that&mdash;not in these parts. I don't know
what the ancient Mohawks may have done,
but the Apaches only want a patch&mdash;smaller
to carry and just as good to show off.
They're collectors, you know&mdash;like a phil-e-a-to-lol-o-gist!"</p>

<p>"Skee, did you say?" pursued the old
lady, regarding him with interest and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>vinced
that there was something wrong with
the name of that species of collector.</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Skee&mdash;Elmer Skee. No'm, <i>not</i>
pronounced 'she.' Do I look like it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Skee was an interesting relic of that
stormy past of the once Wild West which
has left so few surviving. He had crossed
the plains as a child, he told her, in the days
of the prairie schooner, had then and there
lost his parents and his first bit of scalp, was
picked up alive by a party of "movers," and
had grown up in a playground of sixteen
states and territories.</p>

<p>Grandma gazed upon him fascinated. "I
judge you might be interesting to talk
with," she said, after he had given her this
brief sketch of his youth.</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am," said Mr. Skee.
"May I have the pleasure of this dance?"</p>

<p>"I haven't danced in thirty years," said
she, dubitating.</p>

<p>"The more reason for doing it now," he
calmly insisted.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Mrs. Pettigrew, and they
forthwith executed a species of march, the
gentleman pacing with the elaborate grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
of a circus horse, and Grandma stepping at
his side with great decorum.</p>

<p>Later on, warming to the occasion, Mr.
Skee frisked and high-stepped with the
youngest and gayest, and found the supper
so wholly to his liking that he promptly applied
for a room, and as soon as one was
vacant it was given to him.</p>

<p>Vivian danced to her heart's content and
enjoyed the friendly merriment about her;
but when Fordham Greer took her out on
the long piazza to rest and breathe a little,
she saw the dark bulk of the house across
the street and the office with its half-lit
window, and could not avoid thinking of the
lonely man there.</p>

<p>He had not come to the dance, no one expected
that, of course; but all his boys had
come and were having the best of times.</p>

<p>"It's his own fault, of course; but it's a
shame," she thought.</p>

<p>The music sounded gaily from within,
and young Greer urged for another dance.</p>

<p>She stood there for a moment, hesitating,
her hand on his arm, when a tall figure came
briskly up the street from the station, turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
in at their gate, came up the steps&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The girl gave a little cry, and shrank back
for an instant, then eagerly came forward
and gave her hand to him.</p>

<p>It was Morton.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>Vivian's startled cry of welcome
was heard by Susie, perched on
the stairs with several eager youths
gathered as close as might be about her,
and several pairs of hands helped her swift
descent to greet her brother.</p>

<p>Miss Orella, dropping Mr. Dykeman's
arm, came flying from the ball-room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Morton! Morton! When did you
come? Why didn't you let us know? Oh,
my <i>dear</i> boy!"</p>

<p>She haled him into their special parlor,
took his hat away from him, pulled out the
most comfortable chair.</p>

<p>"Have you had supper? And to think
that we haven't a room for you! But there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to be one vacant&mdash;next week. I'll see that
there is. You shall have my room, dear boy.
Oh, I am so glad to see you!"</p>

<p>Susie gave him a sisterly hug, while he
kissed her, somewhat gingerly, on the cheek,
and then she perched herself on the arm of
a chair and gazed upon him with affectionate
interest. Vivian gazed also, busily
engaged in fitting present facts to past
memories.</p>

<p>Surely he had not looked just like that!
The Morton of her girlhood's dream had a
clear complexion, a bright eye, a brave and
gallant look&mdash;the voice only had not
changed.</p>

<p>But here was Morton in present fact,
something taller, it seemed, and a good deal
heavier, well dressed in a rather vivid way,
and making merry over his aunt's devotion.</p>

<p>"Well, if it doesn't seem like old times to
have Aunt 'Rella running 'round like a hen
with her head cut off, to wait on me." The
simile was not unjust, though certainly
ungracious, but his aunt was far too happy
to resent it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>"You sit right still!" she said. "I'll go
and bring you some supper. You must be
hungry."</p>

<p>"Now do sit down and hear to reason,
Auntie!" he said, reaching out a detaining
hand and pulling her into a seat beside him.
"I'm not hungry a little bit; had a good feed
on the diner. Never mind about the room&mdash;I
don't know how long I can stay&mdash;and I
left my grip at the Allen House anyway.
How well you're looking, Auntie! I declare
I'd hardly have known you! And
here's little Susie&mdash;a regular belle! And
Vivian&mdash;don't suppose I dare call you
Vivian now, Miss Lane?"</p>

<p>Vivian gave a little embarrassed laugh.
If he had used her first name she would
never have noticed it. Now that he asked
her, she hardly knew what answer to make,
but presently said:</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I always call you
Morton."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll come when you call me," he
cheerfully replied, leaning forward, elbows
on knees, and looking around the pretty
room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"How well you're fixed here. Guess it
was a wise move, Aunt 'Rella. But I'd
never have dreamed you'd do it. Your Dr.
Bellair must have been a powerful promoter
to get you all out here. I wouldn't have
thought anybody in Bainville could move&mdash;but
me. Why, there's Grandma, as I live!"
and he made a low bow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew, hearing of his arrival
from the various would-be partners of the
two girls, had come to the door and stood
there regarding him with a non-committal
expression. At this address she frowned
perceptibly.</p>

<p>"My name is Mrs. Pettigrew, young man.
I've known you since you were a scallawag
in short pants, but I'm no Grandma of
yours."</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons! Please excuse me,
Mrs. Pettigrew," he said with exaggerated
politeness. "Won't you be seated?" And
he set a chair for her with a flourish.</p>

<p>"Thanks, no," she said. "I'll go back,"
and went back forthwith, attended by Mr.
Skee.</p>

<p>"One of these happy family reunions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
ma'am?" he asked with approving interest.
"If there's one thing I do admire, it's a
happy surprise."</p>

<p>"'Tis some of a surprise," Mrs. Pettigrew
admitted, and became rather glum, in spite
of Mr. Skee's undeniably entertaining conversation.</p>

<p>"Some sort of a fandango going on?"
Morton asked after a few rather stiff moments.
"Don't let me interrupt! On with
the dance! Let joy be unconfined! And if
she must"&mdash;he looked at Vivian, and went
on somewhat lamely&mdash;"dance, why not dance
with me? May I have the pleasure, Miss
Lane?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," cried Miss Orella, "we'd much
rather be with you!"</p>

<p>"But I'd rather dance than talk, any
time," said he, and crooked his elbow to
Vivian with an impressive bow.</p>

<p>Somewhat uncertain in her own mind, and
unwilling to again disappoint Fordham
Greer, who had already lost one dance and
was visibly waiting for her in the hall, the
girl hesitated; but Susie said, "Go on, give
him part of one. I'll tell Mr. Greer." So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Vivian took Morton's proffered arm and
returned to the floor.</p>

<p>She had never danced with him in the
old days; no special memory was here to
contrast with the present; yet something
seemed vaguely wrong. He danced well,
but more actively than she admired, and
during the rest of the evening devoted himself
to the various ladies with an air of long
usage.</p>

<p>She was glad when the dancing was over
and he had finally departed for his hotel,
glad when Susie had at last ceased chattering
and dropped reluctantly to sleep.</p>

<p>For a long time she lay awake trying to
straighten out things in her mind and account
to herself for the sense of vague confusion
which oppressed her.</p>

<p>Morton had come back! That was the
prominent thing, of which she repeatedly
assured herself. How often she had looked
forward to that moment, and felt in anticipation
a vivid joy. She had thought of it in
a hundred ways, always with pleasure, but
never in this particular way&mdash;among so
many strangers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>It must be that which confused her, she
thought, for she was extremely sensitive to
the attitude of those about her. She felt an
unspoken criticism of Morton on the part
of her new friends in the house, and resented
it; yet in her own mind a faint comparison
would obtrude itself between his manners
and those of Jimmie Saunders or Mr. Greer,
for instance. The young Scotchman she
had seen regarding Morton with an undisguised
dislike, and this she inwardly resented,
even while herself disliking his bearing
to his aunt&mdash;and to her grandmother.</p>

<p>It was all contradictory and unsatisfying,
and she fell asleep saying over to herself,
"He has come back! He has come back!"
and trying to feel happy.</p>

<p>Aunt Orella was happy at any rate. She
would not rest until her beloved nephew was
installed in the house, practically turning out
Mr. Gibbs in order to accommodate him.
Morton protested, talked of business and of
having to go away at any time; and Mr.
Gibbs, who still "mealed" with them, secretly
wished he would.</p>

<p>But Morton did not go away. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
long time since he had been petted and
waited on, and he enjoyed it hugely, treating
his aunt with a serio-comic affection that
was sometimes funny, sometimes disagreeable.</p>

<p>At least Susie found it so. Her first surprise
over, she fell back on a fund of sound
common sense, strengthened by present experience,
and found a good deal to criticise
in her returned brother. She was so young
when he left, and he had teased her so unmercifully
in those days, that her early
memories of him were rather mixed in sentiment,
and now he appeared, not as the
unquestioned idol of a manless family in a
well-nigh manless town, but as one among
many; and of those many several were easily
his superiors.</p>

<p>He was her brother, and she loved him, of
course; but there were so many wanting to
be "brothers" if not more, and they were so
much more polite! Morton petted, patronized
and teased her, and she took it all in
good part, as after the manner of brothers,
but his demeanor with other people was not
to her mind.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>His adoring aunt, finding no fault whatever
with this well-loved nephew, lavished
upon him the affection of her unused
motherhood, and he seemed to find it a
patent joke, open to everyone, that she
should be so fond.</p>

<p>To this and, indeed, to his general walk
and conversation, Mrs. Pettigrew took great
exception.</p>

<p>"Fine boy&mdash;Rella's nephew!" she said to
Dr. Bellair late one night when, seeing a
light over her neighbor's transom, she
dropped in for a little chat. Conversation
seemed easier for her here than in the atmosphere
of Bainville.</p>

<p>"Fine boy&mdash;eh? Nice complexion!"</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair was reading a heavy-weight
book by a heavier-weight specialist. She laid
it down, took off her eyeglasses, and rubbed
them.</p>

<p>"Better not kiss him," she said.</p>

<p>"I thought as much!" said Grandma. "I
<i>thought</i> as much! Huh!"</p>

<p>"Nice world, isn't it?" the doctor suggested
genially.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing the matter with the world, that
I know of," her visitor answered.</p>

<p>"Nice people, then&mdash;how's that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing the matter with the people but
foolishness&mdash;plain foolishness. Good land!
Shall we <i>never</i> learn anything!"</p>

<p>"Not till it's too late apparently," the
doctor gloomily agreed, turning slowly in
her swivel chair. "That boy never was
taught anything to protect him. What did
Rella know? Or for that matter, what do any
boys' fathers and mothers know? Nothing,
you'd think. If they do, they won't teach it
to their children."</p>

<p>"Time they did!" said the old lady decidedly.
"High time they did! It's never
too late to learn. I've learned a lot out of
you and your books, Jane Bellair. Interesting
reading! I don't suppose you could give
an absolute opinion now, could you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Dr. Bellair gravely, "no, I
couldn't; not yet, anyway."</p>

<p>"Well, we've got to keep our eyes open,"
Mrs. Pettigrew concluded. "When I think
of that girl of mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;or any girl," the doctor added.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>"You look out for any girl&mdash;that's your
business; I'll look out for mine&mdash;if I can."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew's were not the only eyes
to scrutinize Morton Elder. Through the
peep-hole in the swing door to the kitchen,
Jeanne Jeaune watched him darkly with
one hand on her lean chest.</p>

<p>She kept her watch on whatever went on
in that dining-room, and on the two elderly
waitresses whom she had helped Miss Elder
to secure when the house filled up. They
were rather painfully unattractive, but
seemed likely to stay where no young and
pretty damsel could be counted on for a
year. Morton joked with perseverance
about their looks, and those who were most
devoted to Susie seemed to admire his wit,
while Vivian's special admirers found it
pointless in the extreme.</p>

<p>"Your waitresses are the limit, Auntie,"
he said, "but the cook is all to the good. Is
she a plain cook or a handsome one?"</p>

<p>"Handsome is as handsome does, young
man," Mrs. Pettigrew pointedly replied.
"Mrs. Jones is a first-class cook and her
looks are neither here nor there."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>"You fill me with curiosity," he replied.
"I must go out and make her acquaintance.
I always get solid with the cook; it's worth
while."</p>

<p>The face at the peep-hole darkened and
turned away with a bitter and determined
look, and Master Theophile was hastened
at his work till his dim intelligence wondered,
and then blessed with an unexpected
cookie.</p>

<p>Vivian, Morton watched and followed assiduously.
She was much changed from
what he remembered&mdash;the young, frightened,
slender girl he had kissed under the
lilac bushes, a kiss long since forgotten
among many.</p>

<p>Perhaps the very number of his subsequent
acquaintances during a varied and not
markedly successful career in the newer
states made this type of New England
womanhood more marked. Girls he had
known of various sorts, women old and
young had been kind to him, for Morton
had the rough good looks and fluent manner
which easily find their way to the good will
of many female hearts; but this gentle re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>finement
of manner and delicate beauty had
a novel charm for him.</p>

<p>Sitting by his aunt at meals he studied
Vivian opposite, he watched her in their few
quiet evenings together, under the soft
lamplight on Miss Elder's beloved "center
table;" and studied her continually in the
stimulating presence of many equally devoted
men.</p>

<p>All that was best in him was stirred by
her quiet grace, her reserved friendliness;
and the spur of rivalry was by no means
wanting. Both the girls had their full share
of masculine attention in that busy houseful,
each having her own particular devotees,
and the position of comforter to the others.</p>

<p>Morton became openly devoted to Vivian,
and followed her about, seeking every occasion
to be alone with her, a thing difficult to
accomplish.</p>

<p>"I don't ever get a chance to see anything
of you," he said. "Come on, take a walk
with me&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>"You can see me all day, practically," she
answered. "It seems to me that I never saw
a man with so little to do."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>"Now that's too bad, Vivian! Just because
a fellow's out of a job for a while! It
isn't the first time, either; in my business
you work like&mdash;like anything, part of the
time, and then get laid off. I work hard
enough when I'm at it."</p>

<p>"Do you like it&mdash;that kind of work?" the
girl asked.</p>

<p>They were sitting in the family parlor,
but the big hall was as usual well occupied,
and some one or more of the boarders always
eager to come in. Miss Elder at this moment
had departed for special conference
with her cook, and Susie was at the theatre
with Jimmie Saunders. Fordham Greer
had asked Vivian, as had Morton also, but
she declined both on the ground that she
didn't like that kind of play. Mrs. Pettigrew,
being joked too persistently about
her fondness for "long whist," had retired to
her room&mdash;but then, her room was divided
from the parlor only by a thin partition and
a door with a most inefficacious latch.</p>

<p>"Come over here by the fire," said Morton,
"and I'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>He seated himself on a sofa, comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
adjacent to the fireplace, but Vivian preferred
a low rocker.</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean travelling&mdash;and selling
goods?" he pursued. "Yes, I like it.
There's lots of change&mdash;and you meet people.
I'd hate to be shut up in an office."</p>

<p>"But do you&mdash;get anywhere with it? Is
there any outlook for you? Anything worth
doing?"</p>

<p>"There's a good bit of money to be made,
if you mean that; that is, if a fellow's a good
salesman. I'm no slouch myself, when I
feel in the mood. But it's easy come, easy
go, you see. And it's uncertain. There are
times like this, with nothing doing."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean money, altogether," said
the girl meditatively, "but the work itself;
I don't see any future for you."</p>

<p>Morton was pleased with her interest.
Reaching between his knees he seized the
edge of the small sofa and dragged it a
little nearer, quite unconscious that the act
was distasteful to her.</p>

<p>Though twenty-five years old, Vivian was
extremely young in many ways, and her introspection
had spent itself in tending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
inner shrine of his early image. That ikon
was now jarringly displaced by this insistent
presence, and she could not satisfy herself
yet as to whether the change pleased or displeased
her. Again and again his manner
antagonized her, but his visible devotion
carried an undeniable appeal, and his voice
stirred the deep well of emotion in her heart.</p>

<p>"Look here, Vivian," he said, "you've no
idea how it goes through me to have you
speak like that! You see I've been knocking
around here for all this time, and I
haven't had a soul to take an interest. A
fellow needs the society of good women&mdash;like
you."</p>

<p>It is an old appeal, and always reaches
the mark. To any women it is a compliment,
and to a young girl, doubly alluring. As
she looked at him, the very things she most
disliked, his too free manner, his coarsened
complexion, a certain look about the eyes,
suddenly assumed a new interest as proofs
of his loneliness and lack of right companionship.
What Mrs. St. Cloud had told her
of the ennobling influence of a true woman,
flashed upon her mind.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>"You see, I had no mother," he said simply&mdash;"and
Aunt Rella spoiled me&mdash;." He
looked now like the boy she used to know.</p>

<p>"Of course I ought to have behaved better,"
he admitted. "I was ungrateful&mdash;I
can see it now. But it did seem to me I
couldn't stand that town a day longer!"</p>

<p>She could sympathize with this feeling
and showed it.</p>

<p>"Then when a fellow knocks around as I
have so long, he gets to where he doesn't care
a hang for anything. Seeing you again
makes a lot of difference, Vivian. I think,
perhaps&mdash;I could take a new start."</p>

<p>"Oh do! Do!" she said eagerly. "You're
young enough, Morton. You can do anything
if you'll make up your mind to it."</p>

<p>"And you'll help me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I'll help you&mdash;if I can," said
she.</p>

<p>A feeling of sincere remorse for wasted
opportunities rose in the young man's mind;
also, in the presence of this pure-eyed girl,
a sense of shame for his previous habits. He
walked to the window, his hands in his pockets,
and looked out blankly for a moment.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>"A fellow does a lot of things he
shouldn't," he began, clearing his throat;
she met him more than half way with the
overflowing generosity of youth and ignorance:</p>

<p>"Never mind what you've done, Morton&mdash;you're
going to do differently now!
Susie'll be so proud of you&mdash;and Aunt
Orella!"</p>

<p>"And you?" He turned upon her suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I? Of course! I shall be very
proud of my old friend."</p>

<p>She met his eyes bravely, with a lovely
look of hope and courage, and again his
heart smote him.</p>

<p>"I hope you will," he said and straightened
his broad shoulders manfully.</p>

<p>"Morton Elder!" cried his aunt, bustling
in with deep concern in her voice, "What's
this I hear about you're having a sore
throat?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I hope," said he cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Now, Morton"&mdash;Vivian showed new solicitude&mdash;"you
know you have got a sore
throat; Susie told me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I wish she'd hold her tongue," he
protested. "It's nothing at all&mdash;be all right
in a jiffy. No, I won't take any of your
fixings, Auntie."</p>

<p>"I want Dr. Bellair to look at it anyhow,"
said his aunt, anxiously. "She'll know if it's
diphtheritic or anything. She's coming in."</p>

<p>"She can just go out again," he said with
real annoyance. "If there's anything I've
no use for it's a woman doctor!"</p>

<p>"Oh hush, hush!" cried Vivian, too late.</p>

<p>"Don't apologize," said Dr. Bellair from
her doorway. "I'm not in the least offended.
Indeed, I had rather surmised that that was
your attitude; I didn't come in to prescribe,
but to find Mrs. Pettigrew."</p>

<p>"Want me?" inquired the old lady from
her doorway. "Who's got a sore throat?"</p>

<p>"Morton has," Vivian explained, "and he
won't let Aunt Rella&mdash;why where is she?"</p>

<p>Miss Elder had gone out as suddenly as
she had entered.</p>

<p>"Camphor's good for sore throat," Mrs.
Pettigrew volunteered. "Three or four
drops on a piece of sugar. Is it the swelled
kind, or the kind that smarts?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Halifax!" exclaimed Morton, disgustedly.
"It isn't <i>any</i> kind. I haven't a
sore throat."</p>

<p>"Camphor's good for cold sores; you have
one of them anyhow," the old lady persisted,
producing a little bottle and urging it upon
Morton. "Just keep it wet with camphor
as often as you think of it, and it'll go away."</p>

<p>Vivian looked on, interested and sympathetic,
but Morton put his hand to his lip
and backed away.</p>

<p>"If you ladies don't stop trying to doctor
me, I'll clear out to-morrow, so there!"</p>

<p>This appalling threat was fortunately unheard
by his aunt, who popped in again at
this moment, dragging Dr. Hale with her.
Dr. Bellair smiled quietly to herself.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't tell him what I wanted him
for, or he wouldn't have come, I'm sure&mdash;doctors
are so funny," said Miss Elder,
breathlessly, "but here he is. Now, Dr.
Hale, here's a foolish boy who won't listen
to reason, and I'm real worried about him.
I want you to look at his throat."</p>

<p>Dr. Hale glanced briefly at Morton's
angry face.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>"The patient seems to be of age, Miss Elder;
and, if you'll excuse me, does not seem
to have authorized this call."</p>

<p>"My affectionate family are bound to have
me an invalid," Morton explained. "I'm in
imminent danger of hot baths, cold presses,
mustard plasters, aconite, belladonna and
quinine&mdash;and if I can once reach my hat&mdash;"</p>

<p>He sidled to the door and fled in mock
terror.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your good intentions,
Miss Elder," Dr. Hale remarked drily.
"You can bring water to the horse, but you
can't make him drink it, you see."</p>

<p>"Now that that young man has gone we
might have a game of whist," Mrs. Pettigrew
suggested, looking not ill-pleased.</p>

<p>"For which you do not need me in the
least," and Dr. Hale was about to leave, but
Dr. Bellair stopped him.</p>

<p>"Don't be an everlasting Winter woodchuck,
Dick! Sit down and play; do be
good. I've got to see old Mrs. Graham yet;
she refuses to go to sleep without it&mdash;knowing
I'm so near. By by."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew insisted on playing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Miss Elder, so Vivian had the questionable
pleasure of Dr. Hale as a partner. He was
an expert, used to frequent and scientific
play, and by no means patient with the
girl's mistakes.</p>

<p>He made no protest at a lost trick, but explained
briefly between hands what she
should have remembered and how the cards
lay, till she grew quite discouraged.</p>

<p>Her game was but mediocre, played only
to oblige; and she never could see why people
cared so much about a mere pastime.
Pride came to her rescue at last; the more he
criticised, the more determined she grew to
profit by all this advice; but her mind would
wander now and then to Morton, to his
young life so largely wasted, it appeared,
and to what hope might lie before him. Could
she be the help and stimulus he seemed to
think? How much did he mean by asking
her to help him?</p>

<p>"Why waste a thirteenth trump on your
partner's thirteenth card?" Dr. Hale was
asking.</p>

<p>She flushed a deep rose color and lifted
appealing eyes to him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>"Do forgive me; my mind was elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Will you not invite it to return?" he
suggested drily.</p>

<p>He excused himself after a few games,
and the girl at last was glad to have him go.
She wanted to be alone with her thoughts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew, sitting unaccountably late
at her front window, watched the light burn
steadily in the small office at the opposite
corner. Presently she saw a familiar figure
slip in there, and, after a considerable stay,
come out quietly, cross the street, and let
himself in at their door.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Mrs. Pettigrew.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>Theophile wept aloud in the dining-room,
nursing one hand in the
other, like a hurt monkey.</p>

<p>Most of the diners had departed, but Professor
Toomey and Mr. Cuthbert still lingered
about Miss Susie's corner, to the evident
displeasure of Mr. Saunders, who lingered
also.</p>

<p>Miss Susie smiled upon them all; and Mr.
Saunders speculated endlessly as to whether
this was due to her general friendliness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
disposition, to an interest in pleasing her
aunt's boarders, to personal preference, or,
as he sometimes imagined, to a desire to
tease him.</p>

<p>Morton was talking earnestly with Vivian
at the other end of the table, from which the
two angular waitresses had some time since
removed the last plate. One of them opened
the swing door a crack and thrust her head
in.</p>

<p>"He's burnt his hand," she said, "and his
Ma's out. We don't dare go near him."
Both of these damsels professed great terror
of the poor boy, though he was invariably
good natured, and as timid as a rabbit.</p>

<p>"Do get the doctor!" cried Susie, nervously;
she never felt at ease with Theophile.</p>

<p>"Dr. Bellair, I fear, is not in her office,"
Professor Toomey announced. "We might
summon Dr. Hale."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Mr. Cuthbert, rising
heavily. "He's a great baby, that's all.
Here! Quit that howling and show me your
hand!"</p>

<p>He advanced upon Theophile, who fled
toward Vivian. Morton rose in her de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>fence.
"Get out!" he said, "Go back to the
kitchen. There's nothing the matter with
you."</p>

<p>"Wait till you get burned, and see if you
think it's nothing," Jimmy Saunders remarked
with some acidity. He did not like
Mr. Elder. "Come here youngster, let me
see it."</p>

<p>But the boy was afraid of all of them, and
cowered in a corner, still bawling. "Stop
your noise," Mr. Cuthbert shouted, "Get
out of this, or I'll put you out."</p>

<p>Vivian rose to her feet. "You will do
nothing of the kind. If you, all of you, will
go away, I can quiet Theophile, myself."</p>

<p>Susie went promptly. She had every confidence
in her friend's management. Mr.
Cuthbert was sulky, but followed Susie; and
Mr. Saunders, after some hesitation, followed
Susie, too.</p>

<p>Morton lingered, distrustful.</p>

<p>"Please go, Morton. I know how to manage
him. Just leave us alone," Vivian urged.</p>

<p>"You'd better let me put him out, and
keep him out, till the old woman comes
back," Morton insisted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean kindly, I don't doubt, but
you're making me very angry," said the girl,
flushing; and he reluctantly left the room.
Professor Toomey had departed long since,
to fulfill his suggestion of calling Dr. Hale,
but when that gentleman appeared, he found
that Vivian had quieted the boy, stayed him
with flagons and comforted him with apples,
as it were, and bound up his hand in wet
cooking soda.</p>

<p>"It's not a very bad burn," she told the
doctor, "but it hurt, and he was frightened.
He is afraid of everybody but his mother,
and the men were cross to him."</p>

<p>"I see," said Dr. Hale, watching Theophile
as he munched his apple, keeping carefully
behind Vivian and very near her. "He
does not seem much afraid of you, I notice,
and he's used to me. The soda is all right.
Where did you learn first aid to the injured,
and how to handle&mdash;persons of limited understanding?"</p>

<p>"The former I studied. The latter comes
by nature, I think," replied the girl, annoyed.</p>

<p>He laughed, rather suddenly. "It's a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
good quality, often needed in this world."</p>

<p>"What's all this rumpus?" demanded
Grandma, appearing at the door. "Waking
me up out of my nap!" Grandma's smooth,
fine, still dark hair, which she wore in "water
waves," was somewhat disarranged, and she
held a little shawl about her.</p>

<p>"Only the household baby, playing with
fire," Dr. Hale answered. "Miss Lane resolved
herself into a Red Cross society, and
attended to the wounded. However I think
I'll have a look at it now I'm here."</p>

<p>Then was Vivian surprised, and compelled
to admiration, to see with what wise gentleness
the big man won the confidence of the
frightened boy, examined the hurt hand,
and bound it up again.</p>

<p>"You'll do, all right, won't you Theophile,"
he said, and offered him a shining
nickel and a lozenge, "Which will you have,
old man?"</p>

<p>After some cautious hesitation the boy
chose the lozenge, and hastily applied it
where it would do the most good.</p>

<p>"Where's Mrs. Jones all this time?" suddenly
demanded Grandma, who had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
back to her room and fetched forth three
fat, pink gumdrops for the further consolation
of the afflicted.</p>

<p>"She had to go out to buy clothes for him,
she hardly ever leaves him you know," Vivian
explained. "And the girls out there are
so afraid that they won't take any care of
him."</p>

<p>This was true enough, but Vivian did not
know that "Mrs. Jones" had returned and,
peering through her favorite peephole, had
seen her send out the others, and attend to
the boy's burn with her own hand. Jeanne
Jeaune was not a sentimental person, and
judged from her son's easy consolation that
he was little hurt, but she watched the girl's
prompt tenderness with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"She regards him, as any other boy;"
thought the mother. "His infirmity, she does
not recall it." Dr. Hale had long since won
her approval, and when Theophile at last
ran out, eager to share his gumdrops, he
found her busy as usual in the kitchen.</p>

<p>She was a silent woman, professionally
civil to the waitresses, but never cordial. The
place pleased her, she was saving money, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
she knew that there must be <i>some</i> waitresses&mdash;these
were probably no worse than others.
For her unfortunate son she expected little,
and strove to keep him near her so far as
possible; but Vivian's real kindness touched
her deeply.</p>

<p>She kept a sharp eye on whatever went on
in the dining-room, and what with the frequent
dances and the little groups which
used to hang about the table after meals, or
fill a corner of the big room for quiet chats,
she had good opportunities.</p>

<p>Morton's visible devotion she watched with
deep disapproval; though she was not at all
certain that her "young lady" was favorably
disposed toward him. She could see and
judge the feelings of the men, these many
men who ate and drank and laughed and
paid court to both the girls. Dr. Hale's
brusque coldness she accepted, as from a
higher order of being. Susie's gay coquetries
were transparent to her; but Vivian she
could not read so well.</p>

<p>The girl's deep conscientiousness, her
courtesy and patience with all, and the gentle
way in which she evaded the attentions so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
persistently offered, were new to Jeanne's
experience. When Morton hung about and
tried always to talk with Vivian exclusively,
she saw her listen with kind attention, but
somehow without any of that answering
gleam which made Susie's blue eyes so irresistible.</p>

<p>"She has the lovers, but she has <i>no</i> beauty&mdash;to
compare with my young lady!" Jeanne
commented inwardly.</p>

<p>If the sad-eyed Jeanne had been of Scotch
extraction instead of French, she might have
quoted the explanation of the homely widow
of three husbands when questioned by the
good-looking spinster, who closed her inquiry
by saying aggrievedly, "And ye'r na
sae bonny."</p>

<p>"It's na the bonny that does it," explained
the triple widow, "It's the come hither i' the
een."</p>

<p>Susie's eyes sparkled with the "come
hither," but those who came failed to make
any marked progress. She was somewhat
more cautious after the sudden approach
and overthrow of Mr. A. Smith;
yet more than one young gentleman boarder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
found business called him elsewhere, with
marked suddenness; his place eagerly taken
by another. The Cottonwoods had a waiting
list, now.</p>

<p>Vivian made friends first, lovers afterward.
Then if the love proved vain, the
friendship had a way of lingering. Hers was
one of those involved and over-conscientious
characters, keenly sensitive to the thought of
duty and to others, pain. She could not
play with hearts that might be hurt in the
handling, nor could she find in herself a
quick and simple response to the appeals
made to her; there were so many things to
be considered.</p>

<p>Morton studied her with more intensity
than he had ever before devoted to another
human being; his admiration and respect
grew with acquaintance, and all that was
best in him rose in response to her wise,
sweet womanliness. He had the background
of their childhood's common experiences and
her early sentiment&mdash;how much he did not
know, to aid him. Then there was the unknown
country of his years of changeful
travel, many tales that he could tell her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
many more which he found he could not.</p>

<p>He pressed his advantage, cautiously,
finding the fullest response when he used the
appeal to her uplifting influence. When
they talked in the dining-room the sombre
eye at the peephole watched with growing
disapproval. The kitchen was largely left
to her and her son by her fellow workers,
on account of their nervous dislike for
Theophile, and she utilized her opportunities.</p>

<p>Vivian had provided the boy with some big
bright picture blocks, and he spent happy
hours in matching them on the white scoured
table, while his mother sewed, and watched.
He had forgotten his burn by now, and she
sewed contentedly for there was no one talking
to her young lady but Dr. Hale, who lingered
unaccountably.</p>

<p>To be sure, Vivian had brought him a plate
of cakes from the pantry, and he seemed to
find the little brown things efficiently seductive,
or perhaps it was Grandma who held
him, sitting bolt upright in her usual place,
at the head of one table, and asking a series
of firm but friendly questions. This she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
found the only way of inducing Dr. Hale to
talk at all.</p>

<p>Yes, he was going away&mdash;Yes, he would
be gone some time&mdash;A matter of weeks, perhaps&mdash;He
could not say&mdash;His boys were all
well&mdash;He did not wonder that they saw a
good deal of them&mdash;It was a good place for
them to come.</p>

<p>"You might come oftener yourself," said
Grandma, "and play real whist with me.
These young people play <i>Bridge</i>!" She
used this word with angry scorn, as symbol
of all degeneracy; and also despised
pinochle, refusing to learn it, though any one
could induce her to play bezique. Some of
the more venturous and argumentative,
strove to persuade her that the games were
really the same.</p>

<p>"You needn't tell me," Mrs. Pettigrew
would say, "I don't want to play any of your
foreign games."</p>

<p>"But, Madam, bezique is not an English
word," Professor Toomey had insisted, on
one occasion; to which she had promptly responded,
"Neither is 'bouquet!'"</p>

<p>Dr. Hale shook his head with a smile. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
had a very nice smile, even Vivian admitted
that. All the hard lines of his face curved
and melted, and the light came into those
deep-set eyes and shone warmly.</p>

<p>"I should enjoy playing whist with you
very often, Mrs. Pettigrew; but a doctor
has no time to call his own. And a good
game of whist must not be interrupted by
telephones."</p>

<p>"There's Miss Orella!" said Grandma, as
the front door was heard to open. "She's
getting to be quite a gadder."</p>

<p>"It does her good, I don't doubt," the doctor
gravely remarked, rising to go. Miss
Orella met him in the hall, and bade him
good-bye with regret. "We do not see much
of you, doctor; I hope you'll be back soon."</p>

<p>"Why it's only a little trip; you good people
act as if I were going to Alaska," he said,
"It makes me feel as if I had a family!"</p>

<p>"Pity you haven't," remarked Grandma
with her usual definiteness. Dykeman stood
holding Miss Orella's wrap, with his dry
smile. "Good-bye, Hale," he said. "I'll
chaperon your orphan asylum for you. So
long."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>"Come out into the dining-room," said
Miss Orella, after Dr. Hale had departed.
"I know you must be hungry," and Mr.
Dykeman did not deny it. In his quiet middle-aged
way, he enjoyed this enlarged family
circle as much as the younger fellows, and
he and Mr. Unwin seemed to vie with one
another to convince Miss Orella that life still
held charms for her. Mr. Skee also hovered
about her to a considerable extent, but most
of his devotion was bestowed upon damsels
of extreme youth.</p>

<p>"Here's one that's hungry, anyhow," remarked
Dr. Bellair, coming out of her office
at the moment, with her usual clean and
clear-starched appearance. "I've been at it
for eighteen hours, with only bites to eat.
Yes, all over; both doing well."</p>

<p>It was a source of deep self-congratulation
to Dr. Bellair to watch her friend grow
young again in the new atmosphere. To
Susie it appeared somewhat preposterous,
as her Aunt seems to her mind a permanently
elderly person; while to Mrs. Pettigrew
it looked only natural. "Rella's only
a young thing anyway," was her comment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
But Jane Bellair marked and approved the
added grace of each new gown, the blossoming
of lace and ribbon, the appearance of
long-hoarded bits of family jewelry, things
held "too showy to wear" in Bainville, but
somehow quite appropriate here.</p>

<p>Vivian and Grandma made Miss Orella sit
down at her own table head, and bustled
about in the pantry, bringing cheese and
crackers, cake and fruit; but the doctor
poked her head through the swing door and
demanded meat.</p>

<p>"I don't want a refection, I want food,"
she said, and Jeanne cheerfully brought her
a plate of cold beef. She was much attached
to Dr. Bellair, for reasons many and good.</p>

<p>"What I like about this place," said Mrs.
Pettigrew, surveying the scene from the head
of her table, "is that there's always something
going on."</p>

<p>"What I like about it," remarked Dr. Bellair,
between well-Fletcherized mouthfuls,
"is that people have a chance to grow and
are growing."</p>

<p>"What I like," Mr. Dykeman looked
about him, and paused in the middle of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
sentence, as was his wont; "is being beautifully
taken care of and made comfortable&mdash;any
man likes that."</p>

<p>Miss Orella beamed upon him. Emboldened,
he went on: "And what I like most is
the new, delightful"&mdash;he was gazing admiringly
at her, and she looked so embarrassed
that he concluded with a wide margin of
safety&mdash;"friends I'm making."</p>

<p>Miss Orella's rosy flush, which had risen
under his steady gaze, ebbed again to her
usual soft pink. Even her coldest critics,
in the most caustic Bainvillian circles, could
never deny that she had "a good complexion."
New England, like old England, loves
roses on the cheeks, and our dry Western
winds play havoc with them. But Miss Orella's
bloomed brighter than at home.</p>

<p>"It is pleasant," she said softly; "all this
coming and going&mdash;and the nice people&mdash;who
stay." She looked at no one in particular,
yet Mr. Dykeman seemed pleased.</p>

<p>"There's another coming, I guess," remarked
Grandma, as a carriage was heard
to stop outside, the gate slammed, and
trunk-burdened steps pounded heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
across the piazza. The bell rang sharply,
Mr. Dykeman opened the door, and the
trunk came in first&mdash;a huge one, dumped
promptly on the hall floor.</p>

<p>Behind the trunk and the man beneath it
entered a lady; slim, elegant, graceful, in a
rich silk dust coat and soft floating veils.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Elder!" she said, coming
forward; "and Vivian! Dear Vivian! I
thought you could put me up, somewhere,
and told him to come right here. O&mdash;and
please&mdash;I haven't a bit of change left in my
purse&mdash;will you pay the man?"</p>

<p>"Well, if it isn't Mrs. St. Cloud," said
Grandma, without any note of welcome in
her voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Dykeman paid the man; looked at
the trunk, and paid him some more. The
man departed swearing softly at nothing in
particular, and Mr. Dykeman departed also
to his own room.</p>

<p>Miss Orella's hospitable soul was much
exercised. Refuse shelter to an old acquaintance,
a guest, however unexpected, she could
not; yet she had no vacant room. Vivian,
flushed and excited, moved anew by her old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
attraction, eagerly helped the visitor take
off her wraps, Mrs. Pettigrew standing the
while, with her arms folded, in the doorway
of her room, her thin lips drawn to a hard
line, as one intending to repel boarders at
any risk to life or limb. Dr. Bellair had returned
to her apartments at the first sound
of the visitor's voice.</p>

<p>She, gracious and calm in the midst
of confusion, sat in a wreath of down-dropped
silken wrappings, and held Vivian's
hand.</p>

<p>"You dear child!" she said, "how well you
look! What a charming place this is. The
doctors sent me West for my health; I'm on
my way to California. But when I found
the train stopped here&mdash;I didn't know that
it did till I saw the name&mdash;I had them take
my trunk right off, and here I am! It is
such a pleasure to see you all."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Mrs. Pettigrew, and disappeared
completely, closing the door behind
her.</p>

<p>"Anything will do, Miss Elder," the visitor
went on. "I shall find a hall bedroom
palatial after a sleeping car; or a garret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>&mdash;anything!
It's only for a few days, you
know."</p>

<p>Vivian was restraining herself from hospitable
offers by remembering that her room
was also Susie's, and Miss Orella well knew
that to give up hers meant sleeping on a
hard, short sofa in that all-too-public parlor.
She was hastily planning in her mind to
take Susie in with her and persuade Mrs.
Pettigrew to harbor Vivian, somewhat deterred
by memories of the old lady's expression
as she departed, when Mr. Dykeman
appeared at the door, suitcase in hand.</p>

<p>"I promised Hale I'd keep house for those
fatherless boys, you know," he said. "In
the meantime, you're quite welcome to use
my room, Miss Elder." And he departed,
her blessing going with him.</p>

<p>More light refreshments were now in
order. Mrs. St. Cloud protesting that she
wanted nothing, but finding much to praise
in the delicacies set before her. Several of
the other boarders drifted in, always glad of
an extra bite before going to bed. Susie and
Mr. Saunders returned from a walk, Morton
reappeared, and Jeanne, peering sharply in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
resentful of this new drain upon her pantry
shelves, saw a fair, sweet-faced woman,
seated at ease, eating daintily, while Miss
Elder and Vivian waited upon her, and the
men all gathered admiringly about. Jeanne
Jeaune wagged her head. "Ah, ha, Madame!"
she muttered softly, "Such as you I have
met before!" Theophile she had long since
sent to bed, remaining up herself to keep an
eye on the continued disturbance in the front
of the house. Vivian and Susie brought the
dishes out, and would have washed them or
left them till morning for the maids.</p>

<p>"Truly, no," said Jeanne Jeaune; "go you
to your beds; I will attend to these."</p>

<p>One by one she heard them go upstairs,
distant movement and soft dissuasion as
two gentlemen insisted on bearing Mrs. St.
Cloud's trunk into her room, receding voices
and closing doors. There was no sound in
the dining-room now, but still she waited;
the night was not yet quiet.</p>

<p>Miss Elder and Susie, Vivian also, hovered
about, trying to make this new guest
comfortable, in spite of her graceful protests
that they must not concern themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
in the least about her, that she wanted nothing&mdash;absolutely
nothing. At last they left
her, and still later, after some brief exchange
of surprised comment and warm appreciation
of Mr. Dykeman's thoughtfulness, the
family retired. Vivian, when her long hair
was smoothly braided for the night, felt an
imperative need for water.</p>

<p>"Don't you want some, Susie? I'll bring
you a glass." But Susie only huddled the
bedclothes about her pretty shoulders and
said:</p>

<p>"Don't bring me <i>anything</i>, until to-morrow
morning!"</p>

<p>So her room-mate stole out softly in her
wrapper, remembering that a pitcher of cool
water still stood on one of the tables. The
windows to the street let in a flood of light
from a big street lamp, and she found her
way easily, but was a bit startled for a moment
to find a man still sitting there, his
head upon his arms.</p>

<p>"Why, Morton," she said; "is that you?
What are you sitting up for? It's awfully
late. I'm just after some water." She
poured a glassful. "Don't you want some?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>"No, thank you," he said. "Yes, I will.
Give me some, please."</p>

<p>The girl gave him a glass, drank from her
own and set it down, turning to go, but
he reached out and caught a flowing sleeve
of her kimono.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Vivian! Do sit down and talk
to a fellow. I've been trying to see you for
days and days."</p>

<p>"Why, Morton Elder, how absurd! You
have certainly seen me every day, and we've
talked hours this very evening. This is no
time for conversation, surely."</p>

<p>"The best time in the world," he assured
her. "All the other times there are people
about&mdash;dozens&mdash;hundreds&mdash;swarms! I want
to talk to just you."</p>

<p>There were certainly no dozens or hundreds
about now, but as certainly there was
one, noting with keen and disapproving interest
this midnight tte--tte. It did not
last very long, and was harmless and impersonal
enough while it lasted.</p>

<p>Vivian sat for a few moments, listening
patiently while the young man talked of his
discouragements, his hopes, his wishes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
succeed in life, to be worthy of her; but when
the personal note sounded, when he tried to
take her hand in the semi-darkness, then her
New England conscience sounded also, and
she rose to her feet and left him.</p>

<p>"We'll talk about that another time," she
said. "Now do be quiet and do not wake
people up."</p>

<p>He stole upstairs, dutifully, and she
crept softly back to her room and got into
bed, without eliciting more than a mild
grunt from sleepy Susie. Silence reigned
at last in the house. Not for long, however.</p>

<p>At about half past twelve Dr. Bellair was
roused from a well-earned sleep by a light,
insistent tap upon her door. She listened,
believing it to be a wind-stirred twig; but
no, it was a finger tap&mdash;quiet&mdash;repeated.
She opened the door upon Jeanne in her
stocking feet.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Mrs. Doctor," said the
visitor, "but it is of importance. May I
speak for a little? No, I'm not ill, and we
need not a light."</p>

<p>They sat in the clean little office, the sway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>ing
cottonwood boughs making a changeful
pattern on the floor.</p>

<p>"You are a doctor, and you can make an
end to it&mdash;you must make an end to it," said
Jeanne, after a little hesitation. "This young
man&mdash;this nephew&mdash;he must not marry my
young lady."</p>

<p>"What makes you think he wants to?"
asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"I have seen, I have heard&mdash;I know," said
Jeanne. "You know, all can see that he
loves her. <i>He!</i> Not such as he for my
young lady."</p>

<p>"Why do you object to him, Jeanne?"</p>

<p>"He has lived the bad life," said the woman,
grimly.</p>

<p>"Most young men are open to criticism,"
said Dr. Bellair. "Have you anything
definite to tell me&mdash;anything that you could
<i>prove</i>?&mdash;if it were necessary to save her?"
She leaned forward, elbows on knees.</p>

<p>Jeanne sat in the flickering shadows,
considering her words. "He has had the
sickness," she said at last.</p>

<p>"Can you prove that?"</p>

<p>"I can prove to you, a doctor, that Coralie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
and Anastasia and Estelle&mdash;they have had it.
They are still alive; but not so beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yes; but how can you prove it on him?"</p>

<p>"I know he was with them. Well, it was
no secret. I myself have seen&mdash;he was there
often."</p>

<p>"How on earth have you managed not to
be recognized?" Dr. Bellair inquired after a
few moments.</p>

<p>Jeanne laughed bitterly. "That was eight
years ago; he was but a boy&mdash;gay and foolish,
with the others. What does a boy know?...
Also, at that time I was blonde, and&mdash;of
a difference."</p>

<p>"I see," said the doctor, "I see! That's
pretty straight. You know personally of
that time, and you know the record of those
others. But that was a long time ago."</p>

<p>"I have heard of him since, many times,
in such company," said Jeanne. They sat
in silence for some time. A distant church
clock struck a single deep low note. The
woman rose, stood for a hushed moment,
suddenly burst forth with hushed intensity:
"You must save her, doctor&mdash;you will! I
was young once," she went on. "I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
know&mdash;as she does not. I married, and&mdash;<i>that</i>
came to me! It made me a devil&mdash;for
awhile. Tell her, doctor&mdash;if you must; tell
her about my boy!"</p>

<p>She went away, weeping silently, and Dr.
Bellair sat sternly thinking in her chair, and
fell asleep in it from utter weariness.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Richard Hale left his
brood of temporary orphans without
really expecting for them any
particular oversight from Andrew Dykeman;
but the two were sufficiently close
friends to well warrant the latter in moving
over to The Monastery&mdash;as Jimmie Saunders
called it.</p>

<p>Mr. Dykeman was sufficiently popular
with the young men to be welcome, even if
he had not had a good excuse, and when
they found how super-excellent his excuse
was they wholly approved.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>To accommodate Miss Orella was something&mdash;all
the boys liked Miss Orella. They
speculated among themselves on her increasing
youth and good looks, and even exchanged
sagacious theories as to the particular
acting cause. But when they found
that Mr. Dykeman's visit was to make room
for the installation of Mrs. St. Cloud, they
were more than pleased.</p>

<p>All the unexpressed ideals of masculine
youth seemed centered in this palely graceful
lady; the low, sweet voice, the delicate
hands, the subtle sympathy of manner, the
nameless, quiet charm of dress.</p>

<p>Young Burns became her slave on sight,
Lawson and Peters fell on the second day;
not one held out beyond the third. Even
Susie's attractions paled, her very youth became
a disadvantage; she lacked that large
considering tenderness.</p>

<p>"Fact is," Mr. Peters informed his friends
rather suddenly, "young women are selfish.
Naturally, of course. It takes some experience
to&mdash;well, to understand a fellow." They
all agreed with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Dykeman, quiet and reserved as al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>ways,
was gravely polite to the newcomer,
and Mr. Skee revolved at a distance, making
observations. Occasionally he paid some
court to her, at which times she was cold to
him; and again he devoted himself to the
other ladies with his impressive air, as of one
bowing low and sweeping the floor with a
plumed hat.</p>

<p>Mr. Skee's Stetson had, as a matter of
fact, no sign of plumage, and his bows were
of a somewhat jerky order; but his gallantry
was sweeping and impressive, none the less.
If he remained too far away Mrs. St. Cloud
would draw him to her circle, which consisted
of all the other gentlemen.</p>

<p>There were two exceptions. Mr. James
Saunders had reached the stage where any
woman besides Susie was but a skirted ghost,
and Morton was by this time so deeply devoted
to Vivian that he probably would not
have wavered even if left alone. He was
not wholly a free agent, however.</p>

<p>Adela St. Cloud had reached an age when
something must be done. Her mysterious
absent husband had mysteriously and absently
died, and still she never breathed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
word against him. But the Bible Class in
Bainville furnished no satisfactory material
for further hopes, the place of her earlier
dwelling seemed not wholly desirable now,
and the West had called her.</p>

<p>Finding herself comfortably placed in Mr.
Dykeman's room, and judging from the
number of his shoe-trees and the quality of
his remaining toilet articles that he might be
considered "suitable," she decided to remain
in the half-way house for a season. So settled,
why, for a thousand reasons one must
keep one's hand in.</p>

<p>There were men in plenty, from twenty
year old Archie to the uncertain decades of
Mr. Skee. Idly amusing herself, she questioned
that gentleman indirectly as to his
age, drawing from him astounding memories
of the previous century.</p>

<p>When confronted with historic proof that
the events he described were over a hundred
years passed, he would apologize, admitting
that he had no memory for dates. She owned
one day, with gentle candor, to being thirty-three.</p>

<p>"That must seem quite old to a man like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
you, Mr. Skee. I feel very old sometimes!"
She lifted large eyes to him, and drew her
filmy scarf around her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Your memory must be worse than mine,
ma'am," he replied, "and work the same way.
You've sure got ten or twenty years added
on superfluous! Now me!" He shook his
head; "I don't remember when I was born
at all. And losin' my folks so young, <i>and</i>
the family Bible&mdash;I don't expect I ever
shall. But I 'low I'm all of ninety-seven."</p>

<p>This being palpably impossible, and as the
only local incidents he could recall in his
youth were quite dateless adventures among
the Indians, she gave it up. Why Mr. Skee
should have interested her at all was difficult
to say, unless it was the appeal to his
uncertainty&mdash;he was at least a game fish, if
not edible.</p>

<p>Of the women she met, Susie and Vivian
were far the most attractive, wherefore Mrs.
St. Cloud, with subtle sympathy and engaging
frankness, fairly cast Mr. Saunders in
Susie's arms, and vice versa, as opportunity
occurred.</p>

<p>Morton she rather snubbed, treated him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
as a mere boy, told tales of his childhood that
were in no way complimentary&mdash;so that he
fled from her.</p>

<p>With Vivian she renewed her earlier influence
to a great degree.</p>

<p>With some inquiry and more intuition she
discovered what it was that had chilled the
girl's affection for her.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder, my dear child," she said;
"I never told you of that&mdash;I never speak of
it to anyone.... It was one of the&mdash;"
she shivered slightly&mdash;"darkest griefs of a
very dark time.... He was a beautiful
boy.... I never <i>dreamed</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The slow tears rose in her beautiful eyes
till they shone like shimmering stars.</p>

<p>"Heaven send no such tragedy may ever
come into your life, dear!"</p>

<p>She reached a tender hand to clasp the
girl's. "I am so glad of your happiness!"</p>

<p>Vivian was silent. As a matter of fact,
she was not happy enough to honestly accept
sympathy. Mrs. St. Cloud mistook
her attitude, or seemed to.</p>

<p>"I suppose you still blame me. Many
people did. I often blame myself. One can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>not
be <i>too</i> careful. It's a terrible responsibility,
Vivian&mdash;to have a man love you."</p>

<p>The girl's face grew even more somber.
That was one thing which was troubling her.</p>

<p>"But your life is all before you," pursued
the older woman. "Your dream has come
true! How happy&mdash;how wonderfully happy
you must be!"</p>

<p>"I am not, not <i>really</i>," said the girl. "At
least&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know; I understand," Mrs.
St. Cloud nodded with tender wisdom. "You
are not sure. Is not that it?"</p>

<p>That was distinctly "it," and Vivian so
agreed.</p>

<p>"There is no other man?"</p>

<p>"Not the shadow of one!" said the girl
firmly. And as her questioner had studied
the field and made up her mind to the same
end, she believed her.</p>

<p>"Then you must not mind this sense of
uncertainty. It always happens. It is part
of the morning clouds of maidenhood, my
dear&mdash;it vanishes with the sunrise!" And
she smiled beatifically.</p>

<p>Then the girl unburdened herself of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
perplexities. She could always express herself
so easily to this sympathetic friend.</p>

<p>"There are so many things that I&mdash;dislike&mdash;about
him," she said. "Habits of speech&mdash;of
manners. He is not&mdash;not what I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>"Not all the Dream! Ah! My dear child,
they never are! We are given these beautiful
ideals to guard and guide us; but the real
is never quite the same. But when a man's
soul opens to you&mdash;when he loves&mdash;these
small things vanish. They can be changed&mdash;you
will change them."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;he says so," Vivian admitted. "He
says that he knows that he is&mdash;unworthy&mdash;and
has done wrong things. But so have I,
for that matter."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Cloud agreed with her. "I am
glad you feel that, my dear. Men have their
temptations&mdash;their vices&mdash;and we good women
are apt to be hard on them. But have
we no faults? Ah, my dear, I have seen
good women&mdash;young girls, like yourself&mdash;ruin
a man's whole life by&mdash;well, by heartlessness;
by lack of understanding. Most
young men do things they become ashamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
of when they really love. And in the case
of a motherless boy like this&mdash;lonely, away
from his home, no good woman's influence
about&mdash;what else could we expect? But you
can make a new man of him. A glorious
work!"</p>

<p>"That's what he says. I'm not so sure&mdash;"
The girl hesitated.</p>

<p>"Not sure you can? Oh, my child, it is
the most beautiful work on earth! To see
from year to year a strong, noble character
grow under your helping hand! To be the
guiding star, the inspiration of a man's life.
To live to hear him say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Ah, who am I that God should bow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From heaven to choose a wife for me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What have I done He should endow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My home with thee?'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>Vivian's dark eyes shone with appreciation
for the tender beauty of the lines, the
lovely thought. Then she arose and walked
nervously across the floor, returning presently.</p>

<p>"Mrs. St. Cloud&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call me Adela, my dear."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>"Adela&mdash;dear Adela&mdash;you&mdash;you have
been married. I have no mother. Tell me,
ought not there to be more&mdash;more love? I'm
fond of Morton, of course, and I do want to
help him&mdash;but surely, if I loved him&mdash;I
should feel happier&mdash;more sure!"</p>

<p>"The first part of love is often very confusing,
my dear. I'll tell you how it is: just
because you are a woman grown and feel
your responsibilities, especially here, where
you have so many men friends, you keep
Morton at a distance. Then the external
sort of cousinly affection you have for him
rather blinds you to other feelings. But I
have not forgotten&mdash;and I'm sure you have
not&mdash;the memory of that hot, sweet night
so long ago; the world swimming in summer
moonlight and syringa sweetness; the stillness
everywhere&mdash;and your first kiss!"</p>

<p>Vivian started to her feet. She moved to
the window and stood awhile; came back and
kissed her friend warmly, and went away
without another word.</p>

<p>The lady betook herself to her toilet, and
spent some time on it, for there was one of
Miss Peeder's classes that night.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. St. Cloud danced with many, but
most with Mr. Dykeman; no woman in the
room had her swimming grace of motion,
and yet, with all the throng of partners about
her she had time to see Susie's bright head
bobbing about beneath Mr. Saunders down-bent,
happy face, and Vivian, with her eyes
cast down, dancing with Morton, whose gaze
never left her. He was attention itself, he
brought her precisely the supper she liked,
found her favorite corner to rest in, took her
to sit on the broad piazza between dances,
remained close to her, still talking earnestly,
when all the outsiders had gone.</p>

<p>Vivian found it hard to sleep that night.
All that he had said of his new hope, new
power, new courage, bore out Mrs. St.
Cloud's bright promise of a new-built life.
And some way, as she had listened and did
not forbid, the touch of his hand, the pressure
of his arm, grew warmer and brought
back the memories of that summer night so
long ago.</p>

<p>He had begged hard for a kiss before he
left her, and she quite had to tear herself
away, as Susie drifted in, also late; and Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Orella said they must all go to bed right
away&mdash;she was tired if they were not.</p>

<p>She did look tired. This dance seemed
somehow less agreeable to her than had
others. She took off her new prettinesses
and packed them away in a box in the lower
drawer.</p>

<p>"I'm an old fool!" she said. "Trying to
dress up like a girl. I'm ashamed of myself!"
Quite possibly she did not sleep well
either, yet she had no room-mate to keep her
awake by babbling on, as Susie did to Vivian.</p>

<p>Her discourse was first, last and always
about Jimmie Saunders. He had said this,
he had looked that, he had done so; and what
did Vivian think he meant? And wasn't he
handsome&mdash;and <i>so</i> clever!</p>

<p>Little Susie cuddled close and finally
dropped off asleep, her arms around Vivian.
But the older girl counted the hours; her
head, or her heart, in a whirl.</p>

<p>Morton Elder was wakeful, too. So much
so that he arose with a whispered expletive,
took his shoes in his hand, and let himself
softly out for a tramp in the open.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>This was not the first of his love affairs,
but with all his hot young heart he wished it
was. He stood still, alone on the high
stretches of moonlit mesa and looked up at
the measureless, brilliant spaces above him.</p>

<p>"I'll keep straight&mdash;if I can have her!" he
repeated under his breath. "I will! I will!"</p>

<p>It had never occurred to him before to be
ashamed of the various escapades of his
youth. He had done no more than others,
many others. None of "the boys" he associated
with intended to do what was wrong;
they were quite harsh in judgment of those
who did, according to their standards. None
of them had been made acquainted with the
social or pathological results of their amusements,
and the mere "Zutritt ist Verboten"
had never impressed them at all.</p>

<p>But now the gentler influences of his childhood,
even the narrow morality of Bainville,
rose in pleasant colors in his mind. He
wished he had saved his money, instead of
spending it faster than it came in. He
wished he had kept out of poker and solo and
barrooms generally. He wished, in a dumb,
shamed way, that he could come to her as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
clean as she was. But he threw his shoulders
back and lifted his head determinedly.</p>

<p>"I'll be good to her," he determined; "I'll
make her a good husband."</p>

<p>In the days that followed his devotion was
as constant as before, but more intelligent.
His whole manner changed and softened.
He began to read the books she liked, and
to talk about them. He was gentler to
everyone, more polite, even to the waitresses,
tender and thoughtful of his aunt and sister.
Vivian began to feel a pride in him, and in
her influence, deepening as time passed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew, visiting the library on one
of her frequent errands, was encountered
there and devotedly escorted home by Mr.
Skee.</p>

<p>"That is a most fascinating young lady
who has Mr. Dykeman's room; don't you
think so, ma'am?" quoth he.</p>

<p>"I do not," said Mrs. Pettigrew. "Young!
She's not so young as you are&mdash;nothing like&mdash;never
was!"</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed his
queer laugh, which looked so uproarious and
made so little noise.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>"She certainly is a charmer, whatever her
age may be," he continued.</p>

<p>"Glad you think so, Mr. Skee. It may be
time you lost a fourth!"</p>

<p>"Lost a fourth? What in the&mdash;Hesperides!"</p>

<p>"If you can't guess what, you needn't ask
me!" said the lady, with some tartness. "But
for my own part I prefer the Apaches. Good
afternoon, Mr. Skee."</p>

<p>She betook herself to her room with unusual
promptness, and refused to be baited
forth by any kind of offered amusement.</p>

<p>"It's right thoughtful of Andy Dykeman,
gettin' up this entertainment for Mrs. St.
Cloud, isn't it, Mrs. Elder?" Thus Mr.
Skee to Miss Orella a little later.</p>

<p>"I don't think it is Mr. Dykeman's idea
at all," she told him. "It's those boys over
there. They are all wild about her, quite
naturally." She gave a little short sigh. "If
Dr. Hale were at home I doubt if he would
encourage it."</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure he wouldn't, Ma'am.
He's certainly down on the fair sex, even
such a peacherino as this one. But with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Andy, now, it's different. He is a man of
excellent judgment."</p>

<p>"I guess all men's judgment is pretty
much alike in some ways," said Miss Orella,
oracularly. She seemed busy and constrained,
and Mr. Skee drifted off and paid
court as best he might to Dr. Bellair.</p>

<p>"Charmed to find you at home, Ma'am,"
he said; "or shall I say at office?"</p>

<p>"Call it what you like, Mr. Skee; it's been
my home for a good many years now."</p>

<p>"It's a mighty fine thing for a woman,
livin' alone, to have a business, seems to me,"
remarked the visitor.</p>

<p>"It's a fine thing for any woman, married
or single, to my mind," she answered. "I
wish I could get Vivian Lane started in that
kindergarten she talks about."</p>

<p>"There's kids enough, and goodness
knows they need a gardener! What's
lackin'? House room?"</p>

<p>"She thinks she's not really competent.
She has no regular certificate, you see. Her
parents would never let go of her long
enough," the doctor explained.</p>

<p>"Some parents <i>are</i> pretty graspin', ain't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
they? To my mind, Miss Vivian would be a
better teacher than lots of the ticketed ones.
She's got the natural love of children."</p>

<p>"Yes, and she has studied a great deal.
She just needs an impetus."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if she thought there was 'a call'
she might be willing. I doubt if the families
here realize what they're missin'. Aint there
some among your patients who could be
stirred up a little?"</p>

<p>The doctor thought there were, and he
suggested several names from his apparently
unlimited acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I believe in occupation for the young. It
takes up their minds," said Mr. Skee, and
departed with serenity. He strolled over to
Dr. Hale's fence and leaned upon it, watching
the preparations. Mr. Dykeman, in his
shirt-sleeves, stood about offering suggestions,
while the young men swarmed here and
there with poles and stepladders, hanging
Chinese lanterns.</p>

<p>"Hello, Elmer; come in and make yourself
useful," called Mr. Dykeman.</p>

<p>"I'll come in, but I'll be switched if I'll be
useful," he replied, laying a large hand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the fence and vaulting his long legs over it
with an agility amazing in one of his alleged
years. "You all are sure putting yourself
out for this occasion. Is it somebody's birthday?"</p>

<p>"No; it's a get-up of these youngsters.
They began by wanting Mrs. St. Cloud to
come over to tea&mdash;afternoon tea&mdash;and now
look at this!"</p>

<p>"Did she misunderstand the invitation as
bad as that?"</p>

<p>"O, no; just a gradual change of plan.
One thing leads to another, you know. Here,
Archie! That bush won't hold the line. Put
it on the willow."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mr. Skee; "and, as we're
quotin' proverbs, I might remark that 'While
the cat's away the mice will play.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Dykeman smiled. "It's rather a good
joke on Hale, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Would be if he should happen to come
home&mdash;and find this hen-party on." They
both chuckled.</p>

<p>"I guess he's good for a week yet," said
Mr. Dykeman. "Those medical associations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
do a lot of talking. Higher up there, George&mdash;a
good deal higher."</p>

<p>He ran over to direct the boys, and Mr.
Skee, hands behind him, strolled up and
down the garden, wearing a meditative smile.
He and Andrew Dykeman had been friends
for many long years.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair used her telephone freely after
Mr. Skee's departure, making notes and lists
of names. Late in the afternoon she found
Vivian in the hall.</p>

<p>"I don't see much of you these days, Miss
Lane," she said.</p>

<p>The girl flushed. Since Mrs. St. Cloud's
coming and their renewed intimacy she had
rather avoided the doctor, and that lady had
kept herself conspicuously out of the way.</p>

<p>"Don't call me Miss Lane; I'm Vivian&mdash;to
my friends."</p>

<p>"I hope you count me a friend?" said Dr.
Bellair, gravely.</p>

<p>"I do, Doctor, and I'm proud to. But so
many things have been happening lately,"
she laughed, a little nervously. "The truth
is, I'm really ashamed to talk to you; I'm
so lazy."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>"That's exactly what I wanted to speak
about. Aren't you ready to begin that little
school of yours?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to&mdash;I should, really," said the
girl. "But, somehow, I don't know how to
set about it."</p>

<p>"I've been making some inquiries," said
the doctor. "There are six or eight among
my patients that you could count on&mdash;about
a dozen young ones. How many could you
handle?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I oughtn't to have more than twenty
in any case. A dozen would be plenty to begin
with. Do you think I <i>could</i> count on
them&mdash;really?"</p>

<p>"I tell you what I'll do," her friend offered;
"I'll take you around and introduce
you to any of them you don't know. Most
of 'em come here to the dances. There's
Mrs. Horsford and Mrs. Blake, and that little
Mary Jackson with the twins. You'll
find they are mostly friends."</p>

<p>"You are awfully kind," said the girl. "I
wish"&mdash;her voice took on a sudden note of
intensity&mdash;"I do wish I were strong, like
you, Dr. Bellair."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>"I wasn't very strong&mdash;at your age&mdash;my
child. I did the weakest of weak things&mdash;"</p>

<p>Vivian was eager to ask her what it was,
but a door opened down one side passage
and the doctor quietly disappeared down the
other, as Mrs. St. Cloud came out.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard your voice," she said.
"And Miss Elder's, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"No; it was Dr. Bellair."</p>

<p>"A strong character, and a fine physician,
I understand. I'm sorry she does not like
me."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Cloud's smile made it seem impossible
that anyone should dislike her.</p>

<p>Vivian could not, however, deny the fact,
and was not diplomatic enough to smooth it
over, which her more experienced friend proceeded
to do.</p>

<p>"It is temperamental," she said gently.
"If we had gone to school together we would
not have been friends. She is strong, downright,
progressive; I am weaker, more sensitive,
better able to bear than to do. You
must find her so stimulating."</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl said. "She was talking to
me about my school."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>"Your school?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you know I meant to have a sort
of kindergarten? We planned it even before
starting; but Miss Elder seemed to need
me at first, and since then&mdash;things&mdash;have
happened&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And other things will happen, dear child!
Quite other and different things."</p>

<p>The lady's smile was bewitching. Vivian
flushed slowly under her gaze.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, I watched you dancing together!
You don't mind my noticing, do
you?"</p>

<p>Her voice was suddenly tender and respectful.
"I do not wish to intrude, but you
are very dear to me. Come into my room&mdash;do&mdash;and
tell me what to wear to-night."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Cloud's clothes had always been
a delight to Vivian. They were what she
would have liked to wear&mdash;and never quite
have dared, under the New England fear of
being "too dressy." Her own beauty was
kept trimly neat, like a closed gentian.</p>

<p>Her friend was in the gayest mood. She
showed her a trunkful of delicate garments
and gave her a glittering embroidered scarf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
which the girl rapturously admired, but declared
she would never have the courage to
wear.</p>

<p>"You shall wear it this very night," declared
the lady. "Here&mdash;show me what
you've got. You shall be as lovely as you
<i>are</i>, for once!"</p>

<p>So Vivian brought out her modest wardrobe,
and the older woman chose a gown of
white, insisted on shortening the sleeves to
fairy wings of lace, draped the scarf about
her white neck, raised the soft, close-bound
hair to a regal crown, and put a shining star
in it, and added a string of pearls on the
white throat.</p>

<p>"Look at yourself now, child!" she said.</p>

<p>Vivian looked, in the long depths of Mr.
Dykeman's mirror. She knew that she had
beauty, but had never seen herself so brilliantly
attired. Erect, slender, graceful, the
long lines of her young body draped in soft
white, and her dark head, crowned and shining,
poised on its white column, rising from
the shimmering lace. Her color deepened as
she looked, and added to the picture.</p>

<p>"You shall wear it to-night! You shall!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
cried her admiring friend. "To please me&mdash;if
no one else!"</p>

<p>Whether to please her or someone else,
Vivian consented, the two arriving rather
late at the garden party across the way.</p>

<p>Mr. Dykeman, looking very tall and fine
in his evening clothes, was a cordial host,
ably seconded by the eager boys about him.</p>

<p>The place was certainly a credit to their
efforts, the bare rooms being turned to bowers
by vines and branches brought from the
mountains, and made fragrant by piled
flowers. Lights glimmered through colored
shades among the leaves, and on the dining
table young Peters, who came from Connecticut,
had rigged a fountain by means of
some rubber tubing and an auger hole in the
floor. This he had made before Mr. Dykeman
caught him, and vowed Dr. Hale would
not mind. Mr. Peters' enjoyment of the
evening, however, was a little dampened by
his knowledge of the precarious nature of
this arrangement. He danced attendance
on Mrs. St. Cloud, with the others, but wore
a preoccupied expression, and stole in once
or twice from the lit paths outside to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
sure that all was running well. It was well
to and during supper time, and the young
man was complimented on his ingenuity.</p>

<p>"Reminds me of the Hanging Gardens of
Babylon," said Mr. Skee, sentimentally.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Mrs. Pettigrew.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>why</i>, Ma'am? How can a fellow
say why?" he protested. "Because it is so&mdash;so
efflorescent, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Reminds me of a loose faucet," said she,
<i>sotto voce</i>, to Dr. Bellair.</p>

<p>Mr. Peters beamed triumphantly, but in
the very hour of his glory young Burns,
hastening to get a cup of coffee for his fair
one, tripped over the concealed pipe, and the
fountain poured forth its contributions
among the feet of the guests.</p>

<p>This was a minor misadventure, however,
hurting no one's feeling but Mr. Peters', and
Mrs. St. Cloud was so kind to him in consequence
that he was envied by all the others.</p>

<p>Mr. Dykeman was attentive to his guests,
old and young, but Mrs. Pettigrew had not
her usual smile for him; Miss Orella declined
to dance, alleging that she was too tired, and
Dr. Bellair somewhat dryly told him that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
need not bother with her. He was hardly to
be blamed if he turned repeatedly to Mrs.
St. Cloud, whose tactful sweetness was always
ready. She had her swarm of young
admirers about her, yet never failed to find
a place for her host, a smile and a word of
understanding.</p>

<p>Her eyes were everywhere. She watched
Mr. Skee waltzing with the youngest, providing
well-chosen refreshments for Miss
Orella, gallantly escorting Grandma to see
the "Lovers' Lane" they had made at the
end of the garden. Its twin lines of lights
were all outside; within was grateful shadow.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Cloud paced through this fragrant
arbor with each and every one of the
receiving party, uttering ever-fresh expressions
of admiration and gratitude for their
kind thoughtfulness, especially to Mr. Dykeman.</p>

<p>When she saw Susie and Mr. Saunders
go in at the farther end, she constituted herself
a sort of protective agency to keep every
one else out, holding them in play with various
pleasant arts.</p>

<p>And Vivian? When she arrived there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
a little gasp from Morton, who was waiting
for her near the door. She was indeed a
sight to make a lover's heart leap. He had
then, as it were, surrounded her. Vainly did
the others ask for dances. Morton had unblushingly
filled out a card with his own
name and substituted it for the one she
handed him. She protested, but the music
sounded and he whirled her away before she
could expostulate to any avail.</p>

<p>His eyes spoke his admiration, and for
once his tongue did not spoil the impression.</p>

<p>Half laughing and half serious, she let
him monopolize her, but quite drove him
away when Mr. Dykeman claimed his dance.</p>

<p>"All filled up!" said Morton for her, showing
his card.</p>

<p>"Mine was promised yesterday, was it not,
Miss Lane?" said the big man, smiling. And
she went with him. He took her about the
garden later, gravely admiring and attentive,
and when Susie fairly rushed into her
arms, begging her to come and talk with her,
he left them both in a small rose-crowned
summer-house and went back to Mrs. St.
Cloud.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Vivian, Vivian! What do you
think!" Susie's face was buried on Vivian's
shoulder. "I'm engaged!"</p>

<p>Vivian held her close and kissed her soft
hair. Her joyous excitement was contagious.</p>

<p>"He's the nicest man in the world!"
breathed Susie, "and he loves me!"</p>

<p>"We all supposed he did. Didn't you
know it before?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, in a way; but, Vivian&mdash;he kissed
me!"</p>

<p>"Well, child, have you never in all your
little life been kissed before?"</p>

<p>Susie lifted a rosy, tearful face for a moment.</p>

<p>"Never, never, never!" she said. "I
thought I had, but I haven't! Oh, I am so
happy!"</p>

<p>"What's up?" inquired Morton, appearing
with a pink lantern in his hand, in impatient
search for his adored one. "Susie&mdash;crying?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm <i>not</i>," she said, and ran forthwith
back to the house, whence Jimmy was
bringing her ice cream.</p>

<p>Vivian started to follow her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, Vivian; don't go. Wait." He
dropped the lantern and took her hands. The
paper cover flared up, showing her flushed
cheeks and starry eyes. He stamped out
the flame, and in the sudden darkness caught
her in his arms.</p>

<p>For a moment she allowed him, turning
her head away. He kissed her white shoulder.</p>

<p>"No! No, Morton&mdash;don't! You mustn't!"</p>

<p>She tried to withdraw herself, but he held
her fast. She could feel the pounding of
his heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, Vivian, don't say no! You will marry
me, won't you? Some day, when I'm
more worth while. Say you will! Some
day&mdash;if not now. I love you so; I need you
so! Say yes, Vivian."</p>

<p>He was breathing heavily. His arms held
her motionless. She still kept her face
turned from him.</p>

<p>"Let me go, Morton; let me go! You
hurt me!"</p>

<p>"Say yes, dear, and I'll let you go&mdash;for
a little while."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Vivian.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>The ground jarred beside them, as a tall
man jumped the hedge boundary. He stood
a moment, staring.</p>

<p>"Well, is this my house, or Coney Island?"
they heard him say. And then Morton
swore softly to himself as Vivian left
him and came out.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Dr. Hale," she said, a
little breathlessly. "We weren't expecting
you so soon."</p>

<p>"I should judge not," he answered.
"What's up, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"The boys&mdash;and Mr. Dykeman&mdash;are giving
a garden party for Mrs. St. Cloud."</p>

<p>"For whom?"</p>

<p>"For Adela St. Cloud. She is visiting us.
Aren't you coming in?"</p>

<p>"Not now," he said, and was gone without
another word.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<h3>CONSEQUENCES.</h3>

<div class="poem"  style="margin-left:25%;"><div class="stanza">

<p>Dr. Hale retired from his gaily
illuminated grounds in too much
displeasure to consider the question
of dignity. One suddenly acting
cause was the news given him by Vivian.
The other was the sight of Morton Elder's
face as he struck a match to light his
cigarette.</p>

<p>Thus moved, and having entered and left
his own grounds like a thief in the night, he
proceeded to tramp in the high-lying outskirts
of the town until every light in his
house had gone out. Then he returned, let
himself into his office, and lay there on a
lounge until morning.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>Vivian had come out so quickly to greet
the doctor from obscure motives. She felt
a sudden deep objection to being found
there with Morton, a wish to appear as one
walking about unconcernedly, and when
that match glow made Morton's face shine
out prominently in the dark shelter, she, too,
felt a sudden displeasure.</p>

<p>Without a word she went swiftly to the
house, excused herself to her Grandmother,
who nodded understandingly, and returned
to The Cottonwoods, to her room. She felt
that she must be alone and think; think of
that irrevocable word she had uttered, and
its consequences.</p>

<p>She sat at her window, rather breathless,
watching the rows of pink lanterns swaying
softly on the other side of the street; hearing
the lively music, seeing young couples
leave the gate and stroll off homeward.</p>

<p>Susie's happiness came more vividly to
mind than her own. It was so freshly joyous,
so pure, so perfectly at rest. She could
not feel that way, could not tell with decision
exactly how she did feel. But if this
was happiness, it was not as she had imag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>ined
it. She thought of that moonlit summer
night so long ago, and the memory of
its warm wonder seemed sweeter than the
hasty tumult and compulsion of to-night.</p>

<p>She was stirred through and through by
Morton's intense emotion, but with a sort of
reaction, a wish to escape. He had been so
madly anxious, he had held her so close;
there seemed no other way but to yield to
him&mdash;in order to get away.</p>

<p>And then Dr. Hale had jarred the whole
situation. She had to be polite to him, in
his own grounds. If only Morton had kept
still&mdash;that grating match&mdash;his face, bent and
puffing, Dr. Hale must have seen him. And
again she thought of little Susie with almost
envy. Even after that young lady had
come in, bubbled over with confidences and
raptures, and finally dropped to sleep without
Vivian's having been able to bring herself
to return the confidences, she stole back
to her window again to breathe.</p>

<p>Why had Dr. Hale started so at the name
of Mrs. St. Cloud? That was puzzling her
more than she cared to admit. By and by
she saw his well-known figure, tall and erect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
march by on the other side and go into the
office.</p>

<p>"O, well," she sighed at last, "I'm not
young, like Susie. Perhaps it <i>is</i> like this&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now Morton had been in no special need
of that cigarette at that special moment, but
he did not wish to seem to hide in the dusky
arbor, nor to emerge lamely as if he had
hidden. So he lit the match, more from
habit than anything else. When it was out,
and the cigarette well lighted, he heard the
doctor's sudden thump on the other side of
the fence and came out to rejoin Vivian.
She was not there.</p>

<p>He did not see her again that night, and
his meditations were such that next day
found him, as a lover, far more agreeable to
Vivian than the night before. He showed
real understanding, no triumph, no airs of
possession; took no liberties, only said:
"When I am good enough I shall claim you&mdash;my
darling!" and looked at her with such
restrained longing that she quite warmed
to him again.</p>

<p>He held to this attitude, devoted,
quietly affectionate; till her sense of rebel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>lion
passed away and her real pleasure in
his improvement reasserted itself. As they
read together, if now and then his arm stole
around her waist, he always withdrew it when
so commanded. Still, one cannot put the
same severity into a prohibition too often repeated.
The constant, thoughtful attention
of a man experienced in the art of pleasing
women, the new and frankly inexperienced
efforts he made to meet her highest thoughts,
to learn and share her preferences, both
pleased her.</p>

<p>He was certainly good looking, certainly
amusing, certainly had become a better man
from her companionship. She grew to feel
a sort of ownership in this newly arisen character;
a sort of pride in it. Then, she had
always been fond of Morton, since the time
when he was only "Susie's big brother."
That counted.</p>

<p>Another thing counted, too, counted heavily,
though Vivian never dreamed of it and
would have hotly repudiated the charge. She
was a woman of full marriageable age, with
all the unused powers of her woman's nature
calling for expression, quite unrecognized.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>He was a man who loved her, loved her
more deeply than he had ever loved before,
than he had even known he could love; who
quite recognized what called within him and
meant to meet the call. And he was near
her every day.</p>

<p>After that one fierce outbreak he held
himself well in check. He knew he had
startled her then, almost lost her. And with
every hour of their companionship he felt
more and more how much she was to him.
Other women he had pursued, overtaken,
left behind. He felt that there was something
in Vivian which was beyond him, giving
a stir and lift of aspiration which he
genuinely enjoyed.</p>

<p>Day by day he strove to win her full approval,
and day by day he did not neglect
the tiny, slow-lapping waves of little tendernesses,
small affectionate liberties at well-chosen
moments, always promptly withdrawing
when forbidden, but always beginning
again a little further on.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair went to Dr. Hale's office and
sat herself down solidly in the patient's
chair.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>"Dick," she said, "are you going to stand
for this?"</p>

<p>"Stand for what, my esteemed but cryptic
fellow-practitioner?"</p>

<p>She eyed his calm, reserved countenance
with friendly admiration. "You are an
awfully good fellow, Dick, but dull. At the
same time dull and transparent. Are you
going to sit still and let that dangerous patient
of yours marry the finest girl in town?"</p>

<p>"Your admiration for girls is always
stronger than mine, Jane; and I have, if you
will pardon the boast, more than one patient."</p>

<p>"All right, Dick&mdash;if you want it made
perfectly clear to your understanding. Do
you mean to let Morton Elder marry Vivian
Lane?"</p>

<p>"What business is it of mine?" he demanded,
more than brusquely&mdash;savagely.</p>

<p>"You know what he's got."</p>

<p>"I am a physician, not a detective. And I
am not Miss Lane's father, brother, uncle
or guardian."</p>

<p>"Or lover," added Dr. Bellair, eyeing him
quietly. She thought she saw a second's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
flicker of light in the deep gray eyes, a possible
tightening of set lips. "Suppose you
are not," she said; "nor even a humanitarian.
You <i>are</i> a member of society. Do you
mean to let a man whom you know has no
right to marry, poison the life of that splendid
girl?"</p>

<p>He was quite silent for a moment, but she
could see the hand on the farther arm of his
chair grip it till the nails were white.</p>

<p>"How do you know he&mdash;wishes to marry
her?"</p>

<p>"If you were about like other people, you
old hermit, you'd know it as well as anybody.
I think they are on the verge of an
engagement, if they aren't over it already.
Once more, Dick, shall you do anything?"</p>

<p>"No," said he. Then, as she did not add
a word, he rose and walked up and down
the office in big strides, turning upon her
at last.</p>

<p>"You know how I feel about this. It is a
matter of honor&mdash;professional honor. You
women don't seem to know what the word
means. I've told that good-for-nothing
young wreck that he has no right to marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
for years yet, if ever. That is all I can do.
I will not betray the confidence of a patient."</p>

<p>"Not if he had smallpox, or scarlet fever,
or the bubonic plague? Suppose a patient
of yours had the leprosy, and wanted to
marry your sister, would you betray his confidence?"</p>

<p>"I might kill my sister," he said, glaring
at her. "I refuse to argue with you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you'd better refuse," she
said, rising. "And you don't have to kill
Vivian Lane, either. A man's honor always
seems to want to kill a woman to satisfy it.
I'm glad I haven't got the feeling. Well,
Dick, I thought I'd give you a chance to
come to your senses, a real good chance.
But I won't leave you to the pangs of unavailing
remorse, you poor old goose. That
young syphilitic is no patient of mine." And
she marched off to perform a difficult duty.</p>

<p>She was very fond of Vivian. The girl's
unselfish sweetness of character and the
depth of courage and power she perceived
behind the sensitive, almost timid exterior,
appealed to her. If she had had a daughter,
perhaps she would have been like that. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
she had had a daughter would she not have
thanked anyone who would try to save her
from such a danger? From that worse than
deadly peril, because of which she had no
daughter.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair was not the only one who
watched Morton's growing devotion with
keen interest. To his aunt it was a constant
joy. From the time her boisterous little
nephew had come to rejoice her heart and
upset her immaculate household arrangements,
and had played, pleasantly though
tyrannically, with the little girl next door,
Miss Orella had dreamed this romance for
him. To have it fail was part of her grief
when he left her, to have it now so visibly
coming to completion was a deep delight.</p>

<p>If she had been blind to his faults, she was
at least vividly conscious of the present sudden
growth of virtues. She beamed at him
with affectionate pride, and her manner to
Mrs. Pettigrew was one of barely subdued
"I told you so." Indeed, she could not restrain
herself altogether, but spoke to that
lady with tender triumph of how lovely it
was to have Morton so gentle and nice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>"You never did like the boy, I know, but
you must admit that he is behaving beautifully
now."</p>

<p>"I will," said the old lady; "I'll admit it
without reservation. He's behaving beautifully&mdash;now.
But I'm not going to talk
about him&mdash;to you, Orella." So she rolled
up her knitting work and marched off.</p>

<p>"Too bad she's so prejudiced and opinionated,"
said Miss Elder to Susie, rather
warmly. "I'm real fond of Mrs. Pettigrew,
but when she takes a dislike&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Susie was so happy herself that she seemed
to walk in an aura of rosy light. Her Jimmie
was so evidently the incarnation of
every masculine virtue and charm that he
lent a reflected lustre to other men, even to
her brother. Because of her love for Jimmie,
she loved Morton better&mdash;loved everybody
better. To have her only brother
marry her dearest friend was wholly pleasant
to Susie.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to wring from Vivian
a fair knowledge of how things stood, for,
though reserved by nature, she was utterly
unused to concealing anything, and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
not tell an efficient lie if she wanted to.</p>

<p>"Are you engaged or are you not, you
dear old thing?" demanded Susie.</p>

<p>And Vivian admitted that there was "an
understanding." But Susie absolutely must
not speak of it.</p>

<p>For a wonder she did not, except to Jimmie.
But people seemed to make up their
minds on the subject with miraculous agreement.
The general interest in the manifold
successes of Mrs. St. Cloud gave way to this
vivid personal interest, and it was discussed
from two sides among their whole circle of
acquaintance.</p>

<p>One side thought that a splendid girl was
being wasted, sacrificed, thrown away, on a
disagreeable, good-for-nothing fellow. The
other side thought the "interesting" Mr. Elder
might have done better; they did not
know what he could see in her.</p>

<p>They, that vaguely important They, before
whom we so deeply bow, were also
much occupied in their mind by speculations
concerning Mr. Dykeman and two Possibilities.
One quite patently possible, even
probable, giving rise to the complacent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
"Why, anybody could see that!" and the
other a fascinatingly impossible Possibility
of a sort which allows the even more complacent
"Didn't you? Why, I could see it
from the first."</p>

<p>Mr. Dykeman had been a leading citizen
in that new-built town for some ten years,
which constituted him almost the Oldest Inhabitant.
He was reputed to be extremely
wealthy, though he never said anything
about it, and neither his clothing nor his
cigars reeked of affluence. Perhaps nomadic
chambermaids had spread knowledge of
those silver-backed appurtenances, and the
long mirror. Or perhaps it was not woman's
gossip at all, but men's gossip,
which has wider base, and wider circulation,
too.</p>

<p>Mr. Dykeman had certainly "paid attentions"
to Miss Elder. Miss Elder had undeniably
brightened and blossomed most becomingly
under these attentions. He had
danced with her, he had driven with her, he
had played piquet with her when he might
have played whist. To be sure, he did these
things with other ladies, and had done them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
for years past, but this really looked as if
there might be something in it.</p>

<p>Mr. Skee, as Mr. Dykeman's oldest
friend, was even questioned a little; but it
was not very much use to question Mr. Skee.
His manner was not repellant, and not in the
least reserved. He poured forth floods of
information so voluminous and so varied
that the recipient was rather drowned than
fed. So opinions wavered as to Mr. Dykeman's
intentions.</p>

<p>Then came this lady of irresistible charm,
and the unmarried citizens of the place fell
at her feet as one man. Even the married
ones slanted over a little.</p>

<p>Mr. Dykeman danced with her, more than
he had with Miss Elder. Mr. Dykeman
drove with her, more than he had with Miss
Elder. Mr. Dykeman played piquet with
her, and chess, which Miss Elder could not
play. And Miss Elder's little opening petals
of ribbon and lace curled up and withered
away; while Mrs. St. Cloud's silken efflorescence,
softly waving and jewel-starred,
flourished apace.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair had asked Vivian to take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
walk with her; and they sat together, resting,
on a high lonely hill, a few miles out of
town.</p>

<p>"It's a great pleasure to see this much of
you, Dr. Bellair," said the girl, feeling really
complimented.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you won't think so, my dear,
when you hear what I have to say: what I
<i>have</i> to say."</p>

<p>The girl flushed a little. "Are you going
to scold me about something? Have I done
anything wrong?" Her eyes smiled bravely.
"Go on, Doctor. I know it will be for my
best good."</p>

<p>"It will indeed, dear child," said the doctor,
so earnestly that Vivian felt a chill of
apprehension.</p>

<p>"I am going to talk to you 'as man to
man' as the story books say; as woman to
woman. When I was your age I had been
married three years."</p>

<p>Vivian was silent, but stole out a soft sympathetic
hand and slipped it into the older
woman's. She had heard of this early-made
marriage, also early broken; with various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
dark comments to which she had paid no attention.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair was Dr. Bellair, and she had
a reverential affection for her.</p>

<p>There was a little silence. The Doctor
evidently found it hard to begin. "You love
children, don't you, Vivian?"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes kindled, and a heavenly
smile broke over her face. "Better than
anything in the world," she said.</p>

<p>"Ever think about them?" asked her
friend, her own face whitening as she spoke.
"Think about their lovely little soft helplessness&mdash;when
you hold them in your arms
and have to do <i>everything</i> for them. Have
to go and turn them over&mdash;see that the little
ear isn't crumpled&mdash;that the covers are all
right. Can't you see 'em, upside down on
the bath apron, grabbing at things, perfectly
happy, but prepared to howl when it comes
to dressing? And when they are big enough
to love you! Little soft arms that will
hardly go round your neck. Little soft
cheeks against yours, little soft mouths and
little soft kisses,&mdash;ever think of them?"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes were like stars. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
looking into the future; her breath came
quickly; she sat quite still.</p>

<p>The doctor swallowed hard, and went on.
"We mostly don't go much farther than
that at first. It's just the babies we want.
But you can look farther&mdash;can follow up,
year by year, the lovely changing growing
bodies and minds, the confidence and love
between you, the pride you have as health
is established, strength and skill developed,
and character unfolds and deepens.</p>

<p>"Then when they are grown, and sort of
catch up, and you have those splendid young
lives about you, intimate strong friends and
tender lovers. And you feel as though
you had indeed done something for the
world."</p>

<p>She stopped, saying no more for a little,
watching the girl's awed shining face. Suddenly
that face was turned to her, full of exquisite
sympathy, the dark eyes swimming
with sudden tears; and two soft eager arms
held her close.</p>

<p>"Oh, Doctor! To care like that and
not&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear;" said the doctor, quietly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
"And not have any. Not be able to have
any&mdash;ever."</p>

<p>Vivian caught her breath with pitying intensity,
but her friend went on.</p>

<p>"Never be able to have a child, because I
married a man who had gonorrhea. In place
of happy love, lonely pain. In place of
motherhood, disease. Misery and shame,
child. Medicine and surgery, and never
any possibility of any child for me."</p>

<p>The girl was pale with horror. "I&mdash;I
didn't know&mdash;" She tried to say something,
but the doctor burst out impatiently:</p>

<p>"No! You don't know. I didn't know.
Girls aren't taught a word of what's before
them till it's too late&mdash;not <i>then</i>, sometimes!
Women lose every joy in life, every hope,
every capacity for service or pleasure. They
go down to their graves without anyone's
telling them the cause of it all."</p>

<p>"That was why you&mdash;left him?" asked
Vivian presently.</p>

<p>"Yes, I left him. When I found I could
not be a mother I determined to be a doctor,
and save other women, if I could." She said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
this with such slow, grave emphasis that Vivian
turned a sudden startled face to her,
and went white to the lips.</p>

<p>"I may be wrong," the doctor said, "you
have not given me your confidence in this
matter. But it is better, a thousand times
better, that I should make this mistake than
for you to make that. You must not marry
Morton Elder."</p>

<p>Vivian did not admit nor deny. She still
wore that look of horror.</p>

<p>"You think he has&mdash;That?"</p>

<p>"I do not know whether he has gonorrhea
or not; it takes a long microscopic analysis
to be sure; but there is every practical assurance
that he's had it, and I know he's
had syphilis."</p>

<p>If Vivian could have turned paler she
would have, then.</p>

<p>"I've heard of&mdash;that," she said, shuddering.</p>

<p>"Yes, the other is newer to our knowledge,
far commoner, and really more dangerous.
They are two of the most terrible diseases
known to us; highly contagious, and in the
case of syphilis, hereditary. Nearly three-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>quarters
of the men have one or the other,
or both."</p>

<p>But Vivian was not listening. Her face
was buried in her hands. She crouched low
in agonized weeping.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, come, my dear. Don't take
it so hard. There's no harm done you see,
it's not too late."</p>

<p>"Oh, it <i>is</i> too late! It is!" wailed the girl.
"I have promised to marry him."</p>

<p>"I don't care if you were at the altar, child;
you <i>haven't</i> married him, and you mustn't."</p>

<p>"I have given my word!" said the girl
dully. She was thinking of Morton now.
Of his handsome face, with it's new expression
of respectful tenderness; of all the
hopes they had built together; of his life,
so dependent upon hers for its higher interests.</p>

<p>She turned to the doctor, her lips quivering.
"He <i>loves</i> me!" she said. "I&mdash;we&mdash;he
says I am all that holds him up, that helps
him to make a newer better life. And he has
changed so&mdash;I can see it! He says he has
loved me, really, since he was seventeen!"</p>

<p>The older sterner face did not relax.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>"He told me he had&mdash;done wrong. He
was honest about it. He said he wasn't&mdash;worthy."</p>

<p>"He isn't," said Dr. Bellair.</p>

<p>"But surely I owe some duty to him. He
depends on me. And I have promised&mdash;"</p>

<p>The doctor grew grimmer. "Marriage is
for motherhood," she said. "That is its initial
purpose. I suppose you might deliberately
forego motherhood, and undertake a
sort of missionary relation to a man, but
that is not marriage."</p>

<p>"He loves me," said the girl with gentle
stubbornness. She saw Morton's eyes, as
she had so often seen them lately; full of
adoration and manly patience. She felt his
hand, as she had felt it so often lately, holding
hers, stealing about her waist, sometimes
bringing her fingers to his lips for a strong
slow kiss which she could not forget for
hours.</p>

<p>She raised her head. A new wave of feeling
swept over her. She saw a vista of self-sacrificing
devotion, foregoing much, forgiving
much, but rejoicing in the companionship
of a noble life, a soul rebuilt, a love that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
was passionately grateful. Her eyes met
those of her friend fairly. "And I love
him!" she said.</p>

<p>"Will you tell that to your crippled children?"
asked Dr. Bellair. "Will they understand
it if they are idiots? Will they see it
if they are blind? Will it satisfy you when
they are dead?"</p>

<p>The girl shrank before her.</p>

<p>"You <i>shall</i> understand," said the doctor.
"This is no case for idealism and exalted
emotion. Do you want a son like Theophile?"</p>

<p>"I thought you said&mdash;they didn't have
any."</p>

<p>"Some don't&mdash;that is one result. Another
result&mdash;of gonorrhea&mdash;is to have children
born blind. Their eyes may be saved, with
care. But it is not a motherly gift for one's
babies&mdash;blindness. You may have years and
years of suffering yourself&mdash;any or all of
those diseases 'peculiar to women' as we used
to call them! And we pitied the men who
'were so good to their invalid wives'! You
may have any number of still-born children,
year after year. And every little marred
dead face would remind you that you allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
it! And they may be deformed and twisted,
have all manner of terrible and loathsome
afflictions, they and their children after them,
if they have any. And many do! dear girl,
don't you see that's wicked?"</p>

<p>Vivian was silent, her two hands wrung
together; her whole form shivering with
emotion.</p>

<p>"Don't think that you are 'ruining his
life,'" said the doctor kindly. "He ruined
it long ago&mdash;poor boy!"</p>

<p>The girl turned quickly at the note of
sympathy.</p>

<p>"They don't know either," her friend went
on. "What could Miss Orella do, poor little
saint, to protect a lively young fellow like
that! All they have in their scatter-brained
heads is 'it's naughty but it's nice!' And
so they rush off and ruin their whole lives&mdash;and
their wives'&mdash;and their children's. A
man don't have to be so very wicked, either,
understand. Just one mis-step may be
enough for infection."</p>

<p>"Even if it did break his heart, and yours&mdash;even
if you both lived single, he because it
is the only decent thing he can do now, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
because of a misguided sense of devotion;
that would be better than to commit this
plain sin. Beware of a biological sin, my
dear; for it there is no forgiveness."</p>

<p>She waited a moment and went on, as
firmly and steadily as she would have held
the walls of a wound while she placed the
stitches.</p>

<p>"If you two love each other so nobly and
devotedly that it is higher and truer and
more lasting than the ordinary love of men
and women, you might be 'true' to one another
for a lifetime, you see. And all that
friendship can do, exalted influence, noble
inspiration&mdash;that is open to you."</p>

<p>Vivian's eyes were wide and shining. She
saw a possible future, not wholly unbearable.</p>

<p>"Has he kissed you yet?" asked the doctor
suddenly.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "That is&mdash;except&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't let him. You might catch it.
Your friendship must be distant. Well,
shall we be going back? I'm sorry, my dear.
I did hate awfully to do it. But I hated
worse to see you go down those awful steps
from which there is no returning."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Vivian. "Thank you. Won't
you go on, please? I'll come later."</p>

<p>An hour the girl sat there, with the clear
blue sky above her, the soft steady wind
rustling the leaves, the little birds that
hopped and pecked and flirted their tails so
near her motionless figure.</p>

<p>She thought and thought, and through all
the tumult of ideas it grew clearer to her
that the doctor was right. She might sacrifice
herself. She had no right to sacrifice
her children.</p>

<p>A feeling of unreasoning horror at this
sudden outlook into a field of unknown evil
was met by her clear perception that if she
was old enough to marry, to be a mother, she
was surely old enough to know these things;
and not only so, but ought to know them.</p>

<p>Shy, sensitive, delicate in feeling as the
girl was, she had a fair and reasoning mind.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>It must have grieved anyone who cared
for Andrew Dykeman, to see Mrs.
St. Cloud's manner toward him
change with his changed circumstances&mdash;she
had been so much with him, had been
so kind to him; kinder than Carston comment
"knew for a fact," but not kinder than
it surmised.</p>

<p>Then, though his dress remained as quietly
correct, his face assumed a worn and
anxious look, and he no longer offered her
long auto rides or other expensive entertainment.
She saw men on the piazza stop talking
as he came by, and shake their heads as
they looked after him; but no one would tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
her anything definite till she questioned Mr.
Skee.</p>

<p>"I am worried about Mr. Dykeman," she
said to this ever-willing confidant, beckoning
him to a chair beside her.</p>

<p>A chair, to the mind of Mr. Skee, seemed
to be for pictorial uses, only valuable as
part of the composition. He liked one to
stand beside, to put a foot on, to lean over
from behind, arms on the back; to tip up in
front of him as if he needed a barricade;
and when he was persuaded to sit in one,
it was either facing the back, cross-saddle
and bent forward, or&mdash;and this was
the utmost decorum he was able to approach&mdash;tipped
backward against the wall.</p>

<p>"He does not look well," said the lady,
"you are old friends&mdash;do tell me; if it is
anything wherein a woman's sympathy
would be of service?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not, Ma'am," replied Mr.
Skee darkly. "Andy's hard hit in a worse
place than his heart. I wouldn't betray a
friend's confidence for any money, Ma'am;
but this is all over town. It'll go hard with
Andy, I'm afraid, at his age."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry!" she whispered. "So
sorry! But surely with a man of his abilities
it will be only a temporary reverse!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dunno 'bout the abilities&mdash;not in this
case. Unless he has ability enough to discover
a mine bigger'n the one he's lost! You
see, Ma'am, it's this way," and he sunk his
voice to a confidential rumble. "Andy had
a bang-up mine, galena ore&mdash;not gold, you
understand, but often pays better. And he
kept on putting the money it made back into
it to make more. Then, all of a sudden, it
petered out! No more eggs in that basket.
'Course he can't sell it&mdash;now. And last
year he refused half a million. Andy's sure
down on his luck."</p>

<p>"But he will recover! You western men
are so wonderful! He will find another
mine!"</p>

<p>"O yes, he <i>may</i>! Certainly he <i>may</i>,
Ma'am. Not that he found this one&mdash;he
just bought it."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;he can buy another, there are
more, aren't there?"</p>

<p>"Sure there are! There's as good mines
in the earth as ever was salted&mdash;that's my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
motto! But Andy's got no more money to
buy any mines. What he had before he inherited.
No, Ma'am," said Mr. Skee, with
a sigh. "I'm afraid its all up with Andy
Dykeman financially!"</p>

<p>This he said more audibly; and Miss Elder
and Miss Pettigrew, sitting in their parlor,
could not help hearing. Miss Elder gave a
little gasp and clasped her hands tightly,
but Miss Pettigrew arose, and came outside.</p>

<p>"What's this about Mr. Dykeman?" she
questioned abruptly. "Has he had losses?"</p>

<p>"There now," said Mr. Skee, remorsefully,
"I never meant to give him away like
that. Mrs. Pettigrew, Ma'am, I must beg
you not to mention it further. I was only
satisfyin' this lady here, in answer to sympathetic
anxiety, as to what was making Andrew
H. Dykeman so down in the mouth.
Yes'm&mdash;he's lost every cent he had in the
world, or is likely to have. Of course,
among friends, he'll get a job fast enough,
bookkeepin', or something like that&mdash;though
he's not a brilliant man, Andy isn't. You
needn't to feel worried, Mrs. Pettigrew;
he'll draw a salary all right, to the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
time; but he's out of the game of Hot
Finance."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew regarded the speaker with
a scintillating eye. He returned her look
with unflinching seriousness. "Have a chair,
Ma'am," he said. "Let me bring out your
rocker. Sit down and chat with us."</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said the old lady. "It seems
to me a little&mdash;chilly, out here. I'll go in."</p>

<p>She went in forthwith, to find Miss Orella
furtively wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>"What are you crying about, Orella
Elder! Just because a man's lost his money?
That happens to most of 'em now and then."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know&mdash;but you heard what he
said. Oh, I can't believe it! To think of his
having to be provided for by his friends&mdash;and
having to take a small salary&mdash;after being
so well off! I am so sorry for him!"</p>

<p>Miss Elder's sorrow was increased to intensity
by noting Mrs. St. Cloud's changed
attitude. Mr. Dykeman made no complaint,
uttered no protest, gave no confidences; but
it soon appeared that he was working in an
office; and furthermore that this position was
given him by Mr. Skee.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>That gentleman, though discreetly reticent
as to his own affairs, now appeared in
far finer raiment than he had hitherto affected;
developed a pronounced taste in fobs
and sleeve buttons; and a striking harmony
in socks and scarfs.</p>

<p>Men talked openly of him; no one seemed
to know anything definite, but all were certain
that "Old Skee must have struck it
rich."</p>

<p>Mr. Skee kept his own counsel; but became
munificent in gifts and entertainments.
He produced two imposing presents for
Susie; one a "betrothal gift," the other a
conventional wedding present.</p>

<p>"This is a new one to me," he said when
he offered her the first; "but I understand
it's the thing. In fact I'm sure of it&mdash;for
I've consulted Mrs. St. Cloud and she helped
me to buy 'em."</p>

<p>He consulted Mrs. St. Cloud about a dinner
he proposed giving to Mr. Saunders&mdash;"one
of these Farewell to Egypt affairs,"
he said. "Not that I imagine Jim Saunders
ever was much of a&mdash;Egyptian&mdash;but
then&mdash;&mdash;!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>He consulted her also about Vivian&mdash;did
she not think the girl looked worn and ill?
Wouldn't it be a good thing to send her off
for a trip somewhere?</p>

<p>He consulted her about a library; said he
had always wanted a library of his own, but
the public ones were somewhat in his way.
How many books did she think a man ought
really to own&mdash;to spend his declining years
among. Also, and at considerable length
he consulted her about the best possible place
of residence.</p>

<p>"I'm getting to be an old man, Mrs. St.
Cloud," he remarked meditatively; "and I'm
thinking of buying and building somewhere.
But it's a ticklish job. Lo! these many years
I've been perfectly contented to live wherever
I was at; and now that I'm considering
a real Home&mdash;blamed if I know where
to put it! I'm distracted between A Model
Farm, and A Metropolitan Residence.
Which would you recommend, Ma'am?"</p>

<p>The lady's sympathy and interest warmed
to Mr. Skee as they cooled to Mr. Dykeman,
not with any blameworthy or noticeable
suddenness, but in soft graduations, steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
and continuous. The one wore his new
glories with an air of modest pride; making
no boast of affluence; and the other accepted
that which had befallen him without rebellion.</p>

<p>Miss Orella's tender heart was deeply
touched. As fast as Mrs. St. Cloud gave
the cold shoulder to her friend, she extended
a warm hand; when they chatted about Mr.
Skee's visible success, she spoke bravely of
the beauty of limited means; and when it was
time to present her weekly bills to the boarders,
she left none in Mr. Dykeman's room.
This he took for an oversight at first; but
when he found the omission repeated on the
following week, he stood by his window
smiling thoughtfully for some time, and then
went in search of Miss Orella.</p>

<p>She sat by her shaded lamp, alone, knitting
a silk tie which was promptly hidden as
he entered. He stood by the door looking
at her in spite of her urging him to be seated,
observing the warm color in her face, the
graceful lines of her figure, the gentle
smile that was so unfailingly attractive.
Then he came forward, calmly inquir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>ing,
"Why haven't you sent me my board
bill?"</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to his, and dropped
them, flushing. "I&mdash;excuse me; but I
thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You thought I couldn't conveniently pay
it?"</p>

<p>"O please excuse me! I didn't mean to
be&mdash;to do anything you wouldn't like. But
I did hear that you were&mdash;temporarily embarrassed.
And I want you to feel sure, Mr.
Dykeman, that to your real friends it makes
no difference in the <i>least</i>. And if&mdash;for a
while that is&mdash;it should be a little more convenient
to&mdash;to defer payment, please feel
perfectly at liberty to wait!"</p>

<p>She stood there blushing like a girl, her
sweet eyes wet with shining tears that did
not fall, full of tender sympathy for his misfortune.</p>

<p>"Have you heard that I've lost all my
money?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded softly.</p>

<p>"And that I can't ever get it back&mdash;shall
have to do clerk's work at a clerk's salary&mdash;as
long as I live?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>Again she nodded.</p>

<p>He took a step or two back and forth in
the quiet parlor, and returned to her.</p>

<p>"Would you marry a poor man?" he
asked in a low tender voice. "Would you
marry a man not young, not clever, not rich,
but who loved you dearly? You are the
sweetest woman I ever saw, Orella Elder&mdash;will
you marry me?"</p>

<p>She came to him, and he drew her close
with a long sigh of utter satisfaction. "Now
I am rich indeed," he said softly.</p>

<p>She held him off a little. "Don't talk
about being rich. It doesn't matter. If
you like to live here&mdash;why this house will
keep us both. If you'd rather have a little
one&mdash;I can live <i>so</i> happily&mdash;on <i>so</i> little!
And there is my own little home in Bainville&mdash;perhaps
you could find something to do
there. I don't care the least in the world&mdash;so
long as you love me!"</p>

<p>"I've loved you since I first set eyes on
you," he answered her. "To see the home
you've made here for all of us was enough to
make any man love you. But I thought
awhile back that I hadn't any chance&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
weren't jealous of that Artificial Fairy, were
you?"</p>

<p>And conscientiously Miss Orella lied.</p>

<p>Carston society was pleased, but not surprised
at Susie's engagement; it was both
pleased and surprised when Miss Elder's
was announced. Some there were who protested
that they had seen it from the beginning;
but disputatious friends taxed them
with having prophesied quite otherwise.</p>

<p>Some thought Miss Elder foolish to take
up with a man of full middle age, and with
no prospects; and others attributed the foolishness
to Mr. Dykeman, in marrying an old
maid. Others again darkly hinted that he
knew which side his bread was buttered&mdash;"and
first-rate butter, too." Adding that
they "did hate to see a man sit around and
let his wife keep boarders!"</p>

<p>In Bainville circles the event created high
commotion. That one of their accumulated
maidens, part of the Virgin Sacrifice of New
England, which finds not even a Minotaur&mdash;had
thus triumphantly escaped from their
ranks and achieved a husband; this was flatly
heretical. The fact that he was a poor man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
was the only mitigating circumstance, leaving
it open to the more captious to criticize
the lady sharply.</p>

<p>But the calm contentment of Andrew
Dykeman's face, and the decorous bliss of
Miss Elder's were untroubled by what anyone
thought or said.</p>

<p>Little Susie was delighted, and teased
for a double wedding; without success.
"One was enough to attend to, at one time,"
her aunt replied.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In all this atmosphere of wooings and
weddings, Vivian walked apart, as one in a
bad dream that could never end. That day
when Dr. Bellair left her on the hill, left her
alone in a strange new horrible world, was
still glaring across her consciousness, the end
of one life, the bar to any other. Its small
events were as clear to her as those which
stand out so painfully on a day of death;
all that led up to the pleasant walk, when an
eager girl mounted the breezy height, and
a sad-faced woman came down from it.</p>

<p>She had waited long and came home
slowly, dreading to see a face she knew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
dreading worst of all to see Morton. The
boy she had known so long, the man she was
beginning to know, had changed to an unbelievable
horror; and the love which had so
lately seemed real to her recoiled upon her
heart with a sense of hopeless shame.</p>

<p>She wished&mdash;eagerly, desperately, she
wished&mdash;she need never see him again. She
thought of the man's resource of running
away&mdash;if she could just <i>go</i>, go at once, and
write to him from somewhere.</p>

<p>Distant Bainville seemed like a haven of
safety; even the decorous, narrow, monotony
of its dim life had a new attraction. These
terrors were not in Bainville, surely. Then
the sickening thought crept in that perhaps
they were&mdash;only they did not know it. Besides,
she had no money to go with. If only
she had started that little school sooner!
Write to her father for money she would
not. No, she must bear it here.</p>

<p>The world was discolored in the girl's
eyes. Love had become a horror and marriage
impossible. She pushed the idea from
her, impotently, as one might push at a lava
flow.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>In her wide reading she had learned in a
vague way of "evil"&mdash;a distant undescribed
evil which was in the world, and which must
be avoided. She had known that there was
such a thing as "sin," and abhorred the very
thought of it.</p>

<p>Morton's penitential confessions had given
no details; she had pictured him only as being
"led astray," as being "fast," even perhaps
"wicked." Wickedness could be forgiven;
and she had forgiven him, royally.
But wickedness was one thing, disease was
another. Forgiveness was no cure.</p>

<p>The burden of new knowledge so distressed
her that she avoided the family entirely
that evening, avoided Susie, went to
her grandmother and asked if she might
come and sleep on the lounge in her room.</p>

<p>"Surely, my child, glad to have you," said
Mrs. Pettigrew affectionately. "Better try
my bed&mdash;there's room a-plenty."</p>

<p>The girl lay long with those old arms
about her, crying quietly. Her grandmother
asked no questions, only patted her softly
from time to time, and said, "There! There!"
in a pleasantly soothing manner. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
some time she remarked, "If you want to
say things, my dear, say 'em&mdash;anything you
please."</p>

<p>In the still darkness they talked long and
intimately; and the wise old head straightened
things out somewhat for the younger
one.</p>

<p>"Doctors don't realize how people feel
about these matters," said Mrs. Pettigrew.
"They are so used to all kinds of ghastly
things they forget that other folks can't
stand 'em. She was too hard on you,
dearie."</p>

<p>But Vivian defended the doctor. "Oh,
no, Grandma. She did it beautifully. And
it hurt her so. She told me about her own&mdash;disappointment."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember her as a girl, you see.
A fine sweet girl she was too. It was an
awful blow&mdash;and she took it hard. It has
made her bitter, I think, perhaps; that and
the number of similar cases she had to cope
with."</p>

<p>"But, Grandma&mdash;is it&mdash;<i>can</i> it be as bad
as she said? Seventy-five per cent! Three-quarters
of&mdash;of everybody!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>"Not everybody dear, thank goodness.
Our girls are mostly clean, and they save
the race, I guess."</p>

<p>"I don't even want to <i>see</i> a man again!"
said the girl with low intensity.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't think you would, at first.
But, dear child&mdash;just brace yourself and
look it fair in the face! The world's no
worse than it was yesterday&mdash;just because
you know more about it!"</p>

<p>"No," Vivian admitted, "But it's like
uncovering a charnel house!" she shuddered.</p>

<p>"Never saw a charnel house myself," said
the old lady, "even with the lid on. But
now see here child; you mustn't feel as if
all men were Unspeakable Villains. They
are just ignorant boys&mdash;and nobody ever
tells 'em the truth. Nobody used to know
it, for that matter. All this about gonorrhea
is quite newly discovered&mdash;it has set the
doctors all by the ears. Having women doctors
has made a difference too&mdash;lots of difference."</p>

<p>"Besides," she went on after a pause,
"things are changing very fast now, since
the general airing began. Dr. Prince Mor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>row
in New York, with that society of his&mdash;(I
can never remember the name&mdash;makes
me think of tooth brushes) has done much;
and the popular magazines have taken it
up. You must have seen some of those
articles, Vivian."</p>

<p>"I have," the girl said, "but I couldn't
bear to read them&mdash;ever."</p>

<p>"That's it!" responded her grandmother,
tartly; "we bring up girls to think it is not
proper to know anything about the worst
danger before them. Proper!&mdash;Why my
dear child, the young girls are precisely the
ones <i>to</i> know! it's no use to tell a woman
who has buried all her children&mdash;or wishes
she had!&mdash;that it was all owing to her
ignorance, and her husband's. You have
to know beforehand if it's to do you any
good."</p>

<p>After awhile she continued: "Women are
waking up to this all over the country, now.
Nice women, old and young. The women's
clubs and congresses are taking it up, as
they should. Some states have passed laws
requiring a medical certificate&mdash;a clean bill
of health&mdash;to go with a license to marry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
You can see that's reasonable! A man has
to be examined to enter the army or navy,
even to get his life insured; Marriage and
Parentage are more important than those
things! And we are beginning to teach
children and young people what they ought
to know. There's hope for us!"</p>

<p>"But Grandma&mdash;it's so awful&mdash;about the
children."</p>

<p>"Yes dear, yes. It's pretty awful. But
don't feel as if we were all on the brink of
perdition. Remember that we've got a
whole quarter of the men to bank on.
That's a good many, in this country. We're
not so bad as Europe&mdash;not yet&mdash;in this line.
Then just think of this, child. We have
lived, and done splendid things all these
years, even with this load of disease on us.
Think what we can do when we're rid of it!
And that's in the hands of woman, my dear&mdash;as
soon as we know enough. Don't be
afraid of knowledge. When we all know
about this we can stop it! Think of that.
We can religiously rid the world of all these&mdash;'undesirable
citizens.'"</p>

<p>"How, Grandma?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>"Easy enough, my dear. By not marrying
them."</p>

<p>There was a lasting silence.</p>

<p>Grandma finally went to sleep, making
a little soft whistling sound through her
parted lips; but Vivian lay awake for long
slow hours.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was one thing to make up her own
mind, though not an easy one, by any
means; it was quite another to tell Morton.</p>

<p>He gave her no good opportunity. He
did not say again, "Will you marry me?"
So that she could say, "No," and be done
with it. He did not even say, "When will
you marry me?" to which she could answer
"Never!" He merely took it for granted
that she was going to, and continued to
monopolize her as far as possible, with all
pleasant and comfortable attentions.</p>

<p>She forced the situation even more sharply
than she wished, by turning from him
with a shiver when he met her on the stairs
one night and leaned forward as if to kiss
her.</p>

<p>He stopped short.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the matter, Vivian&mdash;are you
ill?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;" She could say nothing further,
but tried to pass him.</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;there <i>is</i> something. You've
been&mdash;different&mdash;for several days. Have I
done anything you don't like?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Morton!" His question was so exactly
to the point; and so exquisitely inadequate!
He had indeed.</p>

<p>"I care too much for you to let anything
stand between us now," he went on.</p>

<p>"Come, there's no one in the upper hall&mdash;come
and 'tell me the worst.'"</p>

<p>"As well now as ever." thought the girl.
Yet when they sat on the long window seat,
and he turned his handsome face toward her,
with that newer, better look on it, she could
not believe that this awful thing was true.</p>

<p>"Now then&mdash;What is wrong between
us?" he said.</p>

<p>She answered only, "I will tell you the
worst, Morton. I cannot marry you&mdash;ever."</p>

<p>He whitened to the lips, but asked quietly,
"Why?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>"Because you have&mdash;Oh, I <i>cannot</i> tell
you!"</p>

<p>"I have a right to know, Vivian. You
have made a man of me. I love you with
my whole heart. What have I done&mdash;that
I have not told you?"</p>

<p>Then she recalled his contrite confessions;
and contrasted what he had told her with
what he had not; with the unspeakable fate
to which he would have consigned her&mdash;and
those to come; and a sort of holy rage rose
within her.</p>

<p>"You never told me of the state of your
health, Morton."</p>

<p>It was done. She looked to see him fall
at her feet in utter abashment, but he did
nothing of the kind. What he did do astonished
her beyond measure. He rose to
his feet, with clenched fists.</p>

<p>"Has that damned doctor been giving
me away?" he demanded. "Because if he
has I'll kill him!"</p>

<p>"He has not," said Vivian. "Not by the
faintest hint, ever. And is <i>that</i> all you think
of?&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p>She rose to leave him, sick at heart.</p>

<p>Then he seemed to realize that she was
going; that she meant it.</p>

<p>"Surely, surely!" he cried, "you won't
throw me over now! Oh, Vivian! I told
you I had been wild&mdash;that I wasn't fit to
touch your little slippers! And I wasn't
going to ask you to marry me till I felt sure
this was all done with. All the rest of my
life was yours, darling&mdash;is yours. You have
made me over&mdash;surely you won't leave me
now!"</p>

<p>"I must," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her despairingly. If he
lost her he lost not only a woman, but the
hope of a life. Things he had never
thought about before had now grown dear
to him; a home, a family, an honorable place
in the world, long years of quiet happiness.</p>

<p>"I can't lose you!" he said. "I <i>can't</i>!"</p>

<p>She did not answer, only sat there with a
white set face and her hands tight clenched
in her lap.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get this idea anyhow?" he
burst out again. "I believe it's that woman
doctor! What does she know!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here, Morton," said Vivian firmly.
"It is not a question of who told me. The
important thing is that it's&mdash;true! And I
cannot marry you."</p>

<p>"But Vivian&mdash;" he pleaded, trying to
restrain the intensity of his feeling; "men
get over these things. They do, really. It's
not so awful as you seem to think. It's
very common. And I'm nearly well. I
was going to wait a year or two yet&mdash;to
make sure&mdash;. Vivian! I'd cut my hand off
before I'd hurt you!"</p>

<p>There was real agony in his voice, and
her heart smote her; but there was something
besides her heart ruling the girl
now.</p>

<p>"I am sorry&mdash;I'm very sorry," she said
dully. "But I will not marry you."</p>

<p>"You'll throw me over&mdash;just for that!
Oh, Vivian don't&mdash;you can't. I'm no worse
than other men. It seems so terrible to you
just because you're so pure and white. It's
only what they call&mdash;wild oats, you know.
Most men do it."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"And will you punish me&mdash;so cruelly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>&mdash;for
that? I can't live without you, Vivian&mdash;I
won't!"</p>

<p>"It is not a question of punishing you,
Morton," she said gently. "Nor myself.
It is not the sin I am considering. It is
the consequences!"</p>

<p>He felt a something high and implacable
in the gentle girl; something he had never
found in her before. He looked at her with
despairing eyes. Her white grace, her
stately little ways, her delicate beauty, had
never seemed so desirable.</p>

<p>"Good God, Vivian. You can't mean it.
Give me time. Wait for me. I'll be
straight all the rest of my life&mdash;I mean
it. I'll be true to you, absolutely. I'll
do anything you say&mdash;only don't give
me up!"</p>

<p>She felt old, hundreds of years old, and
as remote as far mountains.</p>

<p>"It isn't anything you can do&mdash;in the rest
of your life, my poor boy! It is what you
have done&mdash;in the first of it!... Oh,
Morton! It isn't right to let us grow up
without knowing! You never would have
done it <i>if</i> you'd known&mdash;would you? Can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
you&mdash;can't we&mdash;do something to&mdash;stop this
awfulness?"</p>

<p>Her tender heart suffered in the pain she
was inflicting, suffered too in her own loss;
for as she faced the thought of final separation
she found that her grief ran back into
the far-off years of childhood. But she had
made up her mind with a finality only the
more absolute because it hurt her. Even
what he said of possible recovery did not
move her&mdash;the very thought of marriage had
become impossible.</p>

<p>"I shall never marry," she added, with a
shiver; thinking that he might derive some
comfort from the thought; but he replied
with a bitter derisive little laugh. He did
not rise to her appeal to "help the others."
So far in life the happiness of Morton Elder
had been his one engrossing care; and now
the unhappiness of Morton Elder assumed
even larger proportions.</p>

<p>That bright and hallowed future to which
he had been looking forward so earnestly
had been suddenly withdrawn from him; his
good resolutions, his "living straight" for
the present, were wasted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>"You women that are so superior," he
said, "that'll turn a man down for things
that are over and done with&mdash;that he's sorry
for and ashamed of&mdash;do you know what you
drive a man to! What do you think's going
to become of me if you throw me over!"</p>

<p>He reached out his hands to her in real
agony. "Vivian! I love you! I can't live
without you! I can't be good without you!
And you love me a little&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>She did. She could not deny it. She
loved to shut her eyes to the future, to forgive
the past, to come to those outstretched
arms and bury everything beneath that one
overwhelming phrase&mdash;"I love you!"</p>

<p>But she heard again Dr. Bellair's clear
low accusing voice&mdash;"Will you tell that to
your crippled children?"</p>

<p>She rose to her feet. "I cannot help it,
Morton. I am sorry&mdash;you will not believe
how sorry I am! But I will never marry
you."</p>

<p>A look of swift despair swept over his
face. It seemed to darken visibly as she
watched. An expression of bitter hatred
came upon him; of utter recklessness.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>All that the last few months had seemed
to bring of higher better feeling fell from
him; and even as she pitied him she thought
with a flicker of fear of how this might have
happened&mdash;after marriage.</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" he said, rising to his feet. "I
wish you could have made up your mind
sooner, that's all. I'll take myself off now."</p>

<p>She reached out her hands to him.</p>

<p>"Morton! Please!&mdash;don't go away feeling
so hardly! I am&mdash;fond of you&mdash;I always
was.&mdash;Won't you let me help you&mdash;to
bear it&mdash;! Can't we be&mdash;friends?"</p>

<p>Again he laughed that bitter little laugh.
"No, Miss Lane," he said. "We distinctly
cannot. This is good-bye&mdash;You won't
change your mind&mdash;again?"</p>

<p>She shook her head in silence, and he left
her.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>The inaccessibility of Dr. Hale gave
him, in the eye of Mrs. St. Cloud,
all the attractiveness of an unscaled
peak to the true mountain climber. Here
was a man, an unattached man, living next
door to her, whom she had not even seen.
Her pursuance of what Mr. Skee announced
to his friends to be "one of these Platonic
Friendships," did not falter; neither did
her interest in other relations less philosophic.
Mr. Dykeman's precipitate descent
from the class of eligibles was more of a disappointment
to her than she would admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
even to herself; his firm, kind friendliness
had given a sense of comfort, of achieved
content that her restless spirit missed.</p>

<p>But Dr. Hale, if he had been before inaccessible,
had now become so heavily fortified,
so empanoplied in armor offensive and defensive,
that even Mrs. Pettigrew found it
difficult to obtain speech with him.</p>

<p>That his best friend, so long supporting
him in cheerful bachelorhood, should have
thus late laid down his arms, was bitterly
resented. That Mr. Skee, free lance of
years standing, and risen victor from several
"stricken fields," should show signs of capitulation,
annoyed him further. Whether
these feelings derived their intensity from
another, which he entirely refused to acknowledge,
is matter for the psychologist,
and Dr. Hale avoided all psychologic self-examination.</p>

<p>With the boys he was always a hero. They
admired his quiet strength and the unbroken
good nature that was always presented to
those about him, whatever his inner feelings.</p>

<p>Mr. Peters burst forth to the others one
day, in tones of impassioned admiration.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>"By George, fellows," he said, "you know
how nice Doc was last night?"</p>

<p>"Never saw him when he wasn't," said
Archie.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt Mr. Peters," drawled
Percy. "He's on the brink of a scientific
discovery. Strange how these secrets of
nature can lie unrevealed about us so
long&mdash;and then suddenly burst upon our
ken!"</p>

<p>Mr. Peters grinned affably. "That's all
right, but I maintain my assertion; whatever
the general attraction of our noble host,
you'll admit that on the special occasion of
yesterday evening, which we celebrated to a
late hour by innocent games of cards&mdash;he
was&mdash;as usual&mdash;the soul of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Affability?" suggested Percy.</p>

<p>"Precisely!" Peters admitted. "If there
is a well-chosen word which perfectly describes
the manner of Dr. Richard Hale&mdash;it
is affable! Thank you, sir, thank you. Well,
what I wish to announce, so that you can all
of you get down on your knees at once and
worship, is that all last evening he&mdash;had
a toothache&mdash;a bad toothache!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>"My word!" said Archie, and remained
silent.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now," Percy protested, "that's
against nature. Have a toothache and not
<i>mention</i> it? Not even mention it&mdash;without
exaggeration! Why Archimedes couldn't
do that! Or&mdash;Sandalphon&mdash;or any of them!"</p>

<p>"How'd you learn the facts, my son? Tell
us that."</p>

<p>"Heard him on the 'phone making an appointment.
'Yes;' 'since noon yesterday,'
'yes, pretty severe.' '11:30? You can't make
it earlier? All right.' I'm just mentioning
it to convince you fellows that you don't appreciate
your opportunities. There was
some exceptional Female once&mdash;they said
'to know her was a liberal education.' What
would you call it to live with Dr. Hale?"</p>

<p>And they called it every fine thing they
could think of; for these boys knew better
than anyone else, the effect of that association.</p>

<p>His patients knew him as wise, gentle, efficient,
bringing a sense of hope and assurance
by the mere touch of that strong hand;
his professional associates in the town knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
him as a good practitioner and friend, and
wider medical circles, readers of his articles
in the professional press had an even higher
opinion of his powers.</p>

<p>Yet none of these knew Richard Hale.
None saw him sitting late in his office, the
pages of his book unturned, his eyes on the
red spaces of the fire. No one was with him
on those night tramps that left but an hour
or two of sleep to the long night, and made
that sleep irresistible from self-enforced fatigue.
He had left the associations of his
youth and deliberately selected this far-off
mountain town to build the life he chose; and
if he found it unsatisfying no one was the
wiser.</p>

<p>His successive relays of boys, young fellows
fresh from the East, coming from year
to year and going from year to year as business
called them, could and did give good
testimony as to the home side of his character,
however. It was not in nature that
they should speculate about him. As they
fell in love and out again with the facility of
so many Romeos, they discoursed among
themselves as to his misogyny.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>"He certainly has a grouch on women,"
they would admit. "That's the one thing
you can't talk to him about&mdash;shuts up like a
clam. Of course, he'll let you talk about
your own feelings and experiences, but you
might as well talk to the side of a hill. I
wonder what did happen to him?"</p>

<p>They made no inquiry, however. It was
reported that a minister's wife, a person of
determined character, had had the courage
of her inquisitiveness, and asked him once,
"Why is it that you have never married, Dr.
Hale?" And that he had replied, "It is
owing to my dislike of the meddlesomeness
of women." He lived his own life, unquestioned,
now more markedly withdrawn than
ever, coming no more to The Cottonwoods.</p>

<p>Even when Morton Elder left, suddenly
and without warning, to the great grief of
his aunt and astonishment of his sister, their
medical neighbor still "sulked in his tent"&mdash;or
at least in his office.</p>

<p>Morton's departure had but one explanation;
it must be that Vivian had refused him,
and she did not deny it.</p>

<p>"But why, Vivian, why? He has im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>proved
so&mdash;it was just getting lovely to see
how nice he was getting. And we all thought
you were so happy." Thus the perplexed
Susie. And Vivian found herself utterly
unable to explain to that happy little heart,
on the brink of marriage, why she had refused
her brother.</p>

<p>Miss Orella was even harder to satisfy.
"It's not as if you were a foolish changeable
young girl, my dear. And you've known
Morton all your life&mdash;he was no stranger to
you. It breaks my heart, Vivian. Can't
you reconsider?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry, Miss Orella. Please
believe that I did it for the best&mdash;and that it
was very hard for me, too."</p>

<p>"But, Vivian! What can be the reason?
I don't think you understand what a beautiful
influence you have on the boy. He has
improved so, since he has been here. And he
was going to get a position here in town&mdash;he
told me so himself&mdash;and really settle down.
And now he's <i>gone</i>. Just off and away, as
he used to be&mdash;and I never shall feel easy
about him again."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Orella was frankly crying; and it
wrung the girl's heart to know the pain she
was causing; not only to Morton, and to
herself, but to these others.</p>

<p>Susie criticised her with frankness.</p>

<p>"I know you think you are right, Vivian,
you always do&mdash;you and that conscience of
yours. But I really think you had gone too
far to draw back, Jimmie saw him that night
he went away&mdash;and he said he looked awfully.
And he really was changed so&mdash;beginning
to be so thoroughly nice. Whatever
was the matter? I think you ought to tell
me, Vivian, I'm his sister, and&mdash;being engaged
and all&mdash;perhaps I could straighten
it out."</p>

<p>And she was as nearly angry as her sunny
nature allowed, when her friend refused to
give any reason, beyond that she thought it
right.</p>

<p>Her aunt did not criticise, but pleaded.
"It's not too late, I'm sure, Vivian. A word
from you would bring him back in a moment.
Do speak it, Vivian&mdash;do! Put your pride
in your pocket, child, and don't lose a lifetime's
happiness for some foolish quarrel."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Orella, like Susie, was at present
sure that marriage must mean a lifetime's
happiness. And Vivian looked miserably
from one to the other of these loving women-folk,
and could not defend herself with the
truth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew took up the cudgels for
her. She was not going to have her favorite
grandchild thus condemned and keep silence.
"Anybody'd think Vivian had married the
man and then run away with another one!"
she said tartly. "Pity if a girl can't change
her mind before marrying&mdash;she's held down
pretty close afterward. An engagement isn't
a wedding, Orella Elder."</p>

<p>"But you don't consider the poor boy's
feelings in the least, Mrs. Pettigrew."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," snapped the old lady. "I
consider the poor girl's. I'm willing to bet
as much as you will that his feelings aren't
any worse than hers. If <i>he'd</i> changed his
mind and run off and left <i>her</i>, I warrant you
two wouldn't have been so hard on him."</p>

<p>Evading this issue, Miss Orella wiped her
eyes, and said: "Heaven knows where he is
now. And I'm afraid he won't write&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
never did write much, and now he's just
heartbroken. I don't know as I'd have seen
him at all if I hadn't been awake and heard
him rushing downstairs. You've no idea
how he suffers."</p>

<p>"I don't see as the girl's to blame that he
hadn't decency enough to say good-bye to
the aunt that's been a mother to him; or to
write to her, as he ought to. A person don't
need to forget <i>all</i> their duty because they've
got the mitten."</p>

<p>Vivian shrank away from them all. Her
heart ached intolerably. She had not realized
how large a part in her life this constant
admiration and attention had become. She
missed the outward agreeableness, and the
soft tide of affection, which had risen more
and more warmly about her. From her
earliest memories she had wished for affection&mdash;affection
deep and continuous, tender
and with full expression. She had been too
reserved to show her feeling, too proud by
far to express it, but under that delicate reticence
of hers lay always that deep longing
to love and to be loved wholly.</p>

<p>Susie had been a comfort always, in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
kittenish affection and caressing ways, but
Susie was doubly lost, both in her new absorption
and now in this estrangement.</p>

<p>Then, to bring pain to Miss Orella, who
had been so kind and sweet to her from earliest
childhood, to hurt her so deeply, now,
to mingle in her cup of happiness this grief
and anxiety, made the girl suffer keenly.
Jimmie, of course, was able to comfort Susie.
He told her it was no killing matter anyhow,
and that Morton would inevitably console
himself elsewhere. "He'll never wear the
willow for any girl, my dear. Don't you
worry about him."</p>

<p>Also, Mr. Dykeman comforted Miss Orella,
not only with wise words, but with his
tender sympathy and hopefulness. But no
one could comfort Vivian.</p>

<p>Even Dr. Bellair seemed to her present
sensitiveness an alien, cruel power. She had
come like the angel with the flaming sword
to stand between her and what, now that it
was gone, began to look like Paradise.</p>

<p>She quite forgot that she had always
shrunk from Morton when he made love too
warmly, that she had been far from wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
pleased with him when he made his appearance
there, that their engagement, so far as
they had one, was tentative&mdash;"sometime,
when I am good enough" not having arrived.
The unreasoning voice of the woman's nature
within her had answered, though but
partially, to the deep call of the man's; and
now she missed more than she would admit
to herself the tenderness that was gone.</p>

<p>She had her intervals of sharp withdrawal
from the memory of that tenderness, of deep
thanksgiving for her escape; but fear of a
danger only prophesied, does not obliterate
memory of joys experienced.</p>

<p>Her grandmother watched her carefully,
saying little. She forced no confidence,
made no comment, was not obtrusively affectionate,
but formed a definite decision
and conveyed it clearly to Dr. Bellair.</p>

<p>"Look here, Jane Bellair, you've upset
Vivian's dish, and quite right; it's a good
thing you did, and I don't know as you could
have done it easier."</p>

<p>"I couldn't have done it harder&mdash;that I
know of," the doctor answered. "I'd sooner
operate on a baby&mdash;without an ansthetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>&mdash;than
tell a thing like that&mdash;to a girl like that.
But it had to be done; and nobody else
would."</p>

<p>"You did perfectly right. I'm thankful
enough, I promise you; if you hadn't I
should have had to&mdash;and goodness knows
what a mess I'd have made. But look
here, the girl's going all to pieces. Now
we've got to do something for her, and do
it quick."</p>

<p>"I know that well enough," answered her
friend, "and I set about it even before I
made the incision. You've seen that little
building going up on the corner of High
and Stone Streets?"</p>

<p>"That pretty little thing with the grass
and flowers round it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;they got the flowers growing while
the decorators finished inside. It's a first-rate
little kindergarten. I've got a list of
scholars all arranged for, and am going to
pop the girl into it so fast she can't refuse.
Not that I think she will."</p>

<p>"Who did it?" demanded Mrs. Pettigrew.
"That man Skee?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Skee has had something to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
it," replied the doctor, guardedly; "but he
doesn't want his name mentioned."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Mrs. Pettigrew.</p>

<p>Vivian made no objection, though she was
too listless to take up work with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>As a prescription nothing could have
worked better. Enough small pupils were
collected to pay the rent of the pretty place,
and leave a modest income for her.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellair gathered together the mothers
and aunts for a series of afternoon talks in
the convenient building, Vivian assisting,
and roused much interest among them. The
loving touch of little hands, the pleasure of
seeing the gay contentment of her well-ordered
charges, began to lighten the girl's
heart at last. They grew so fond of her that
the mothers were jealous, but she played
with and taught them so wisely, and the
youngsters were so much improved by it,
that no parent withdrew her darling.</p>

<p>Further than that, the new interest, the
necessary reading and study, above all the
study hours of occupation acted most beneficently,
slowly, but surely steadying the
nerves and comforting the heart.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>There is a telling Oriental phrase describing
sorrow: "And the whole world became
strait unto him." The sense of final closing
down of life, of a dull, long, narrow path
between her and the grave, which had so oppressed
the girl's spirit, now changed rapidly.
Here was room to love at least, and she
radiated a happy and unselfish affection
among the little ones. Here was love in return,
very sweet and honest, if shallow. Here
was work; something to do, something to
think about; both in her hours with the children
and those spent in study. Her work
took her out of the house, too; away from
Susie and her aunt, with their happy chatter
and endless white needlework, and the gleeful
examination of presents.</p>

<p>Never before had she known the blessed
relief of another place to go to.</p>

<p>When she left The Cottonwoods, as early
as possible, and placed her key in the door of
the little gray house sitting among the roses,
she felt a distinct lightening of the heart.
This was hers. Not her father's, not Miss
Elder's; not anybody's but hers&mdash;as long as
she could earn the rent.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>She paid her board, too, in spite of deep
and pained remonstrance, forcing Miss Elder
to accept it by the ultimatum "would you
rather make me go away and board somewhere
else?" She could not accept favors
where she was condemned.</p>

<p>This, too, gave her a feeling hitherto inexperienced,
deep and inspiring. She began
to hold her graceful head insensibly higher,
to walk with a freer step. Life was not
ended after all, though Love had gone. She
might not be happy, but she might be useful
and independent.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Bellair, who had by quiet friendliness
and wise waiting, regained much of
her former place with the girl, asked her to
undertake, as a special favor to her, the care
of a class of rather delicate children and
young girls, in physical culture.</p>

<p>"Of course, Johanna Johnson is perfectly
reliable and an excellent teacher. I don't
know a better; but their mothers will feel
easier if there's someone they know on the
spot. You keep order and see that they
don't overdo. You'll have to go through
their little exercises with them, you see. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
can't pay you anything for it; but it's only
part of two afternoons in the week&mdash;and it
won't hurt you at any rate."</p>

<p>Vivian was more than glad to do something
for the doctor, as well as to extend her
friendship among older children; also glad
of anything to further fill her time. To be
alone and idle was to think and suffer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew came in with Dr. Bellair
one afternoon to watch the exercises.</p>

<p>"I don't see but what Vivian does the
tricks as well as any of them," said her
grandmother.</p>

<p>"She does beautifully," the doctor answered.
"And her influence with the children
is just what they needed. You see
there's no romping and foolishness, and she
sets the pace&mdash;starts them off when they're
shy. I'm extremely obliged to her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew watched Vivian's rhythmic
movements, her erect carriage and
swinging step, her warm color and sparkling
eyes, as she led the line of happy youngsters
and then turned upon the doctor.</p>

<p>"Huh!" she said.</p>

<p>At Susie's wedding, her childhood's friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
was so far forgiven as to be chief bridesmaid,
but seeing the happiness before her opened
again the gates of her own pain.</p>

<p>When it was all over, and the glad young
things were safely despatched upon their
ribboned way, when all the guests had gone,
when Mrs. St. Cloud felt the need of air and
with the ever-gallant Mr. Skee set forth in
search of it, when Dr. Bellair had returned
to her patients, and Miss Orella to her own
parlor, and was there consoled by Mr. Dykeman
for the loss of her niece, then Vivian
went to her room&mdash;all hers now, looking
strangely large and empty&mdash;and set down
among the drifts of white tissue paper and
scattered pins&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>She sank down on the bed, weary and sad
at heart, for an hour of full surrender long
refused; meaning for once to let her grief
have its full way with her. But, just as on
the night of her hurried engagement she had
been unable to taste to the full the happiness
expected, so now, surrender as she might,
she could not feel the intensity of expected
pain.</p>

<p>She was lonely, unquestionably. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
faced a lonely life. Six long, heavy months
had passed since she had made her decision.</p>

<p>"I am nearly twenty-seven now," she
thought, resignedly. "I shall never marry,"
and she felt a little shiver of the horror of
last year.</p>

<p>But, having got this far in melancholy contemplation,
her mind refused to dwell upon
it, but filled in spite of her with visions of
merry little ones, prancing in wavering circles,
and singing their more wavering songs.
She was lonely and a single woman&mdash;but she
had something to do; and far more power to
do it, more interest, enthusiasm, and skill,
than at the season's beginning.</p>

<p>She thought of Morton&mdash;of what little
they had heard since his hurried departure.
He had gone farther West; they had heard
of him in San Francisco, they had heard of
him, after some months, in the Klondike region,
then they had heard no more. He did
not write. It seemed hard to so deeply hurt
his aunt for what was no fault of hers; but
Morton had never considered her feelings
very deeply, his bitter anger, his hopeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>ness,
his desperate disappointment, blinding
him to any pain but his own.</p>

<p>But her thoughts of him failed to rouse
any keen distinctive sorrow. They rambled
backward and forward, from the boy who
had been such a trouble to his aunt, such a
continuous disappointment and mortification;
to the man whose wooing, looked back
upon at this distance, seemed far less attractive
to the memory than it had been at the
time. Even his honest attempt at improvement
gave her but a feeling of pity, and
though pity is akin to love it is not always a
near relation.</p>

<p>From her unresisting descent into wells of
pain, which proved unexpectedly shallow,
the girl arose presently and quietly set to
work arranging the room in its new capacity
as hers only.</p>

<p>From black and bitter agony to the gray
tastelessness of her present life was not an
exciting change, but Vivian had more power
in quiet endurance than in immediate resistance,
and set herself now in earnest to fulfill
the tasks before her.</p>

<p>This was March. She was planning an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
extension of her classes, the employment of
an assistant. Her work was appreciated, her
school increased. Patiently and steadily she
faced her task, and found a growing comfort
in it. When summer came, Dr. Bellair again
begged her to help out in the plan of a girls'
camp she was developing.</p>

<p>This was new work for Vivian, but her season
in Mrs. Johnson's gymnastic class had
given her a fresh interest in her own body
and the use of it. That stalwart instructress,
a large-boned, calm-eyed Swedish woman,
was to be the manager of the camp, and
Vivian this time, with a small salary attached,
was to act as assistant.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful thing the way people
take to these camps," said Dr. Bellair.
"They are springing up everywhere. Magnificent
for children and young people."</p>

<p>"It is a wonderful thing to me," observed
Mrs. Pettigrew. "You go to a wild place
that costs no rent; you run a summer hotel
without any accommodations; you get a lot
of parents to pay handsomely for letting
their children be uncomfortable&mdash;and there
you are."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>"They are not uncomfortable!" protested
her friend, a little ruffled. "They like it.
And besides liking it, it's good for them. It's
precisely the roughing it that does them
good."</p>

<p>It did do them good; the group of young
women and girls who went to the high-lying
mountain lake where Dr. Bellair had bought
a piece of wild, rough country for her own
future use, and none of them profited by it
more than Vivian.</p>

<p>She had been, from time to time, to decorous
"shore places," where one could do nothing
but swim and lie on the sand; or to the
"mountains," those trim, green, modest,
pretty-picture mountains, of which New
England is so proud; but she had never before
been in an untouched wilderness.</p>

<p>Often in the earliest dawn she would rise
from the springy, odorous bed of balsam
boughs and slip out alone for her morning
swim. A run through the pines to a little
rocky cape, with a small cave she knew, and
to glide, naked, into that glass-smooth water,
warmer than the sunless air, and swim out
softly, silently, making hardly a ripple, turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
on her back and lie there&mdash;alone with the
sky&mdash;this brought peace to her heart. She
felt so free from every tie to earth, so like a
soul in space, floating there with the clean,
dark water beneath her, and the clear, bright
heaven above her; and when the pale glow in
the east brightened to saffron, warmed to
rose, burst into a level blaze of gold, the lake
laughed in the light, and Vivian laughed, too,
in pure joy of being alive and out in all that
glittering beauty.</p>

<p>She tramped the hills with the girls;
picked heaping pails of wild berries, learned
to cook in primitive fashion, slept as she had
never slept in her life, from dark to dawn,
grew brown and hungry and cheerful.</p>

<p>After all, twenty-seven was not an old age.</p>

<p>She came back at the summer-end, and Dr.
Bellair clapped her warmly on the shoulder,
declaring, "I'm proud of you, Vivian! Simply
proud of you!"</p>

<p>Her grandmother, after a judicious embrace,
held her at arm's length and examined
her critically.</p>

<p>"I don't see but what you've stood it first
rate," she admitted. "And if you <i>like</i> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
color&mdash;why, you certainly are looking well."</p>

<p>She was well, and began her second year
of teaching with a serene spirit.</p>

<p>In all this time of slow rebuilding Vivian
would not have been left comfortless if masculine
admiration could have pleased her.
The young men at The Cottonwoods, now
undistracted by Susie's gay presence, concentrated
much devotion upon Vivian, as did
also the youths across the way. She turned
from them all, gently, but with absolute decision.</p>

<p>Among her most faithful devotees was
young Percy Watson, who loved her almost
as much as he loved Dr. Hale, and could
never understand, in his guileless, boyish
heart, why neither of them would talk about
the other.</p>

<p>They did not forbid his talking, however,
and the earnest youth, sitting in the quiet
parlor at The Cottonwoods, would free his
heart to Vivian about how the doctor worked
too hard&mdash;sat up all hours to study&mdash;didn't
give himself any rest&mdash;nor any fun.</p>

<p>"He'll break down some time&mdash;I tell him
so. It's not natural for any man to work that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
way, and I don't see any real need of it. He
says he's working on a book&mdash;some big medical
book, I suppose; but what's the hurry? I
wish you'd have him over here oftener, and
make him amuse himself a little, Miss Vivian."</p>

<p>"Dr. Hale is quite welcome to come at any
time&mdash;he knows that," said she.</p>

<p>Again the candid Percy, sitting on the doctor's
shadowy piazza, poured out his devoted
admiration for her to his silent host.</p>

<p>"She's the finest woman I ever knew!" the
boy would say. "She's so beautiful and so
clever, and so pleasant to everybody. She's
<i>square</i>&mdash;like a man. And she's kind&mdash;like a
woman, only kinder; a sort of motherliness
about her. I don't see how she ever lived so
long without being married. I'd marry her
in a minute if I was good enough&mdash;and if
she'd have me."</p>

<p>Dr. Hale tousled the ears of Balzac, the
big, brown dog whose head was so often on
his knee, and said nothing. He had not seen
the girl since that night by the arbor.</p>

<p>Later in the season he learned, perforce,
to know her better, and to admire her more.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>Susie's baby came with the new year, and
brought danger and anxiety. They hardly
hoped to save the life of the child. The little
mother was long unable to leave her bed.
Since her aunt was not there, but gone, as
Mrs. Dykeman, on an extended tour&mdash;"part
business and part honeymoon," her husband
told her&mdash;and since Mrs. Pettigrew now
ruled alone at The Cottonwoods, with every
evidence of ability and enjoyment, Vivian
promptly installed herself in the Saunders
home, as general housekeeper and nurse.</p>

<p>She was glad then of her strength, and
used it royally, comforting the wretched Jim,
keeping up Susie's spirits, and mothering the
frail tiny baby with exquisite devotion.</p>

<p>Day after day the doctor saw her, sweet
and strong and patient, leaving her school to
the assistant, regardless of losses, showing
the virtues he admired most in women.</p>

<p>He made his calls as short as possible; but
even so, Vivian could not but note how his
sternness gave way to brusque good cheer for
the sick mother, and to a lovely gentleness
with the child.</p>

<p>When that siege was over and the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
returned to her own work, she carried pleasant
pictures in her mind, and began to wonder,
as had so many others, why this man,
who seemed so fitted to enjoy a family, had
none.</p>

<p>She missed his daily call, and wondered
further why he avoided them more assiduously
than at first.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>Upon all this Grandma Pettigrew
cast an observant eye, and meditated
sagely thereupon. Coming to
a decision, she first took a course of reading
in some of Dr. Bellair's big books, and
then developed a series of perplexing symptoms,
not of a too poignant or perilous nature,
that took her to Dr. Hale's office frequently.</p>

<p>"You haven't repudiated Dr. Bellair, have
you?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"I have never consulted Jane Bellair as a
physician," she replied, "though I esteem her
much as a friend."</p>

<p>The old lady's company was always wel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>come
to him; he liked her penetrating eye,
her close-lipped, sharp remarks, and appreciated
the real kindness of her heart.</p>

<p>If he had known how closely she was peering
into the locked recesses of his own, and
how much she saw there, he would perhaps
have avoided her as he did Vivian, and if he
had known further that this ingenious old
lady, pursuing long genealogical discussions
with him, had finally unearthed a mutual
old-time friend, and had forthwith started
a correspondence with that friend, based on
this common acquaintance in Carston, he
might have left that city.</p>

<p>The old-time friend, baited by Mrs. Pettigrew's
innocent comment on Dr. Hale's persistence
in single blessedness, poured forth
what she knew of the cause with no more
embellishment than time is sure to give.</p>

<p>"I know why he won't marry," wrote she.
"He had reason good to begin with, but I
never dreamed he'd be obstinate enough to
keep it up sixteen years. When he was a
boy in college here I knew him well&mdash;he was
a splendid fellow, one of the very finest. But
he fell desperately in love with that beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Mrs. James&mdash;don't you remember about
her? She married a St. Cloud later, and he
left her, I think. She was as lovely as a
cameo&mdash;and as hard and flat. That woman
was the saintliest thing that ever breathed.
She wouldn't live with her husband because
he had done something wrong; she wouldn't
get a divorce, nor let him, because that was
wicked&mdash;and she always had a string of boys
round her, and talked about the moral influence
she had on them.</p>

<p>"Young Hale worshipped her&mdash;simply
worshipped her&mdash;and she let him. She let
them all. She had that much that was god-like
about her&mdash;she loved incense. You need
not ask for particulars. She was far too
'particular' for that. But one light-headed
chap went and drowned himself&mdash;that was
all hushed up, of course, but some of us felt
pretty sure why. He was a half-brother to
Dick Hale, and Dick was awfully fond of
him. Then he turned hard and hateful all
at once&mdash;used to talk horrid about women.
He kept straight enough&mdash;that's easy for a
mysogynist, and studying medicine didn't
help him any&mdash;doctors and ministers know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
too much about women. So there you are.
But I'm astonished to hear he's never gotten
over it; he always was obstinate&mdash;it's his
only fault. They say he swore never to
marry&mdash;if he did, that accounts. Do give
my regards if you see him again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew considered long and deeply
over this information, as she slowly produced
a jersey striped with Roman vividness.
It was noticeable in this new life in
Carston that Mrs. Pettigrew's knitted jackets
had grown steadily brighter in hue from
month to month. Whereas, in Bainville,
purple and brown were the high lights, and
black, slate and navy blue the main colors;
now her worsteds were as a painter's palette,
and the result not only cheered, but bade
fair to inebriate.</p>

<p>"A pig-headed man," she said to herself,
as her needle prodded steadily in and out;
"a pig-headed man, with a pig-headedness of
sixteen years' standing. His hair must 'a
turned gray from the strain of it. And
there's Vivian, biddin' fair to be an old maid
after all. What on <i>earth</i>!" She appeared
to have forgotten that marriages are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
in heaven, or to disregard that saying. "The
Lord helps those that help themselves," was
one of her favorite mottoes. "And much
more those that help other people!" she used
to add.</p>

<p>Flitting in and out of Dr. Hale's at all
hours, she noted that he had a fondness for
music, with a phenomenal incapacity to produce
any. He encouraged his boys to play
on any and every instrument the town afforded,
and to sing, whether they could or
not; and seemed never to weary of their attempts,
though far from satisfied with the
product.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Mrs. Pettigrew.</p>

<p>Vivian could play, "Well enough to know
better," she said, and seldom touched the
piano. She had a deep, full, contralto voice,
and a fair degree of training. But she would
never make music unless she felt like it&mdash;and
in this busy life, with so many people about
her, she had always refused.</p>

<p>Grandma meditated.</p>

<p>She selected an evening when most of the
boarders were out at some entertainment,
and selfishly begged Vivian to stay at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
with her&mdash;said she was feeling badly and
wanted company. Grandma so seldom
wanted anything that Vivian readily acquiesced;
in fact, she was quite worried about
her, and asked Dr. Bellair if she thought
anything was the matter.</p>

<p>"She has seemed more quiet lately," said
that astute lady, "and I've noticed her going
in to Dr. Hale's during office hours. But
perhaps it's only to visit with him."</p>

<p>"Are you in any pain, Grandma?" asked
the girl, affectionately. "You're not sick,
are you?"</p>

<p>"O, no&mdash;I'm not sick," said the old lady,
stoutly. "I'm just&mdash;well, I felt sort of lonesome
to-night&mdash;perhaps I'm homesick."</p>

<p>As she had never shown the faintest sign
of any feeling for their deserted home, except
caustic criticism and unfavorable comparison,
Vivian rather questioned this theory,
but she began to think there was something
in it when her grandmother, sitting by
the window in the spring twilight, began to
talk of how this time of year always made
her think of her girlhood.</p>

<p>"Time for the March peepers at home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
It's early here, and no peepers anywhere
that I've heard. 'Bout this time we'd be
going to evening meeting. Seems as if I
could hear that little old organ&mdash;and the
singing!"</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better shut that window,"
asked Vivian. "Won't you get cold?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said her grandmother,
promptly. "I'm plenty warm&mdash;I've got this
little shawl around me. And it's so soft and
pleasant out."</p>

<p>It was soft and pleasant, a delicious May-like
night in March, full of spring scents and
hints of coming flowers. On the dark piazza
across the way she could make out a still
figure sitting alone, and the thump of Balzac's
heel as he struggled with his intimate
enemies told her who it was.</p>

<p>"Come Ye Disconsolate," she began to
hum, most erroneously. "How does that go,
Vivian? I was always fond of it, even if I
can't sing any more'n a peacock."</p>

<p>Vivian hummed it and gave the words in
a low voice.</p>

<p>"That's good!" said the old lady. "I declare,
I'm kinder hungry for some of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
old hymns. I wish you'd play me some of
'em, Vivian."</p>

<p>So Vivian, glad to please her, woke the
yellow keys to softer music than they were
accustomed to, and presently her rich, low
voice, sure, easy, full of quiet feeling, flowed
out on the soft night air.</p>

<p>Grandma was not long content with the
hymns. "I want some of those old-fashioned
songs&mdash;you used to know a lot of 'em. Can't
you do that 'Kerry Dance' of Molloy's, and
'Twickenham Ferry'&mdash;and 'Lauriger Horatius?'"</p>

<p>Vivian gave her those, and many another,
Scotch ballads, English songs and German
Lieder&mdash;glad to please her grandmother so
easily, and quite unconscious of a dark figure
which had crossed the street and come silently
to sit on the farthest corner of their
piazza.</p>

<p>Grandma, meanwhile, watched him, and
Vivian as well, and then, with the most unsuspected
suddenness, took to her bed.
Sciatica, she said. An intermittent pain
that came upon her so suddenly she couldn't
stand up. She felt much better lying down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
And Dr. Hale must attend her unceasingly.</p>

<p>This unlooked for overthrow of the phenomenally
active old lady was a great blow
to Mr. Skee; he showed real concern and
begged to be allowed to see her.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Mrs. Pettigrew. "It's
nothing catching."</p>

<p>She lay, high-pillowed, as stiff and well
arranged as a Knight Templar on a tombstone,
arrayed for the occasion in a most
decorative little dressing sack and ribbony
night-cap.</p>

<p>"Why, ma'am," said Mr. Skee, "it's
highly becomin' to you to be sick. It leads
me to hope it's nothin' serious."</p>

<p>She regarded him enigmatically. "Is Dr.
Hale out there, or Vivian?" she inquired in
a low voice.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am&mdash;they ain't," he replied, after
a glance in the next room.</p>

<p>Then he bent a penetrating eye upon her.
She met it unflinchingly, but as his smile
appeared and grew, its limitless widening
spread contagion, and her calm front was
broken.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<p>"Elmer Skee," said she, with sudden fury,
"you hold your tongue!"</p>

<p>"Ma'am!" he replied, "I have said nothin'&mdash;and
I don't intend to. But if the
throne of Europe was occupied by you,
Mrs. Pettigrew, we would have a better
managed world."</p>

<p>He proved a most agreeable and steady
visitor during this period of confinement,
and gave her full accounts of all that went
on outside, with occasional irrelevant bursts
of merriment which no rebuke from Mrs.
Pettigrew seemed wholly to check.</p>

<p>He regaled her with accounts of his continuous
consultations with Mrs. St. Cloud,
and the wisdom and good taste with which
she invariably advised him.</p>

<p>"Don't you admire a Platonic Friendship,
Mrs. Pettigrew?"</p>

<p>"I do not!" said the old lady, sharply.
"And what's more I don't believe you do."</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am," he answered, swaying
backward and forward on the hind legs of
his chair, "there are moments when I confess
it looks improbable."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew cocked her head on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
side and turned a gimlet eye upon him.
"Look here, Elmer Skee," she said suddenly,
"how much money have you really
got?"</p>

<p>He brought down his chair on four legs
and regarded her for a few moments, his
smile widening slowly. "Well, ma'am, if I
live through the necessary expenses involved
on my present undertaking, I shall have
about two thousand a year&mdash;if rents are
steady."</p>

<p>"Which I judge you do not wish to be
known?"</p>

<p>"If there's one thing more than another
I have always admired in you, ma'am, it is
the excellence of your judgment. In it I
have absolute confidence."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Cloud had some time since summoned
Dr. Hale to her side for a severe
headache, but he had merely sent word that
his time was fully occupied, and recommended
Dr. Bellair.</p>

<p>Now, observing Mrs. Pettigrew's tactics,
the fair invalid resolved to take the bull by
the horns and go herself to his office. She
found him easily enough. He lifted his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
as she entered, rose and stood with folded
arms regarding her silently. The tall, heavy
figure, the full beard, the glasses, confused
even her excellent memory. After all it was
many years since they had met, and he had
been but one of a multitude.</p>

<p>She was all sweetness and gentle apology
for forcing herself upon him, but really
she had a little prejudice against women
doctors&mdash;his reputation was so great&mdash;he
was so temptingly near&mdash;she was in such
pain&mdash;she had such perfect confidence in
him&mdash;</p>

<p>He sat down quietly and listened, watching
her from under his bent brows. Her
eyes were dropped, her voice very weak and
appealing; her words most perfectly chosen.</p>

<p>"I have told you," he said at length, "that
I never treat women for their petty ailments,
if I can avoid it."</p>

<p>She shook her head in grieved acceptance,
and lifted large eyes for one of those
penetrating sympathetic glances so frequently
successful.</p>

<p>"How you must have suffered!" she said.</p>

<p>"I have," he replied grimly. "I have suf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>fered
a long time from having my eyes
opened too suddenly to the brainless cruelty
of women, Mrs. James."</p>

<p>She looked at him again, searchingly,
and gave a little cry. "Dick Hale!" she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dick Hale. Brother to poor little
Joe Medway, whose foolish young heart
you broke, among others; whose death you
are responsible for."</p>

<p>She was looking at him with widening wet
eyes. "Ah! If you only knew how I, too,
have suffered over that!" she said. "I was
scarce more than a girl myself, then. I was
careless, not heartless. No one knew what
pain I was bearing, then. I liked the admiration
of those nice boys&mdash;I never realized
any of them would take it seriously. That
has been a heavy shadow on my life, Dr.
Hale&mdash;the fear that I was the thoughtless
cause of that terrible thing. And you have
never forgiven me. I do not wonder."</p>

<p>He was looking at her in grim silence
again, wishing he had not spoken.</p>

<p>"So that is why you have never been to
The Cottonwoods since I came," she pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>sued.
"And I am responsible for all your
loneliness. O, how dreadful!"</p>

<p>Again he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"No, madam, you mistake. You were responsible
for my brother's death, and for a
bitter awakening on my part, but you are
in no way responsible for my attitude since.
That is wholly due to myself. Allow me
again to recommend Dr. Jane Bellair, an
excellent physician and even more accessible."</p>

<p>He held the door for her, and she went
out, not wholly dissatisfied with her visit.
She would have been far more displeased
could she have followed his thoughts afterward.</p>

<p>"What a Consummate Ass I have been all
my life!" he was meditating. "Because I
met this particular type of sex parasite, to
deliberately go sour&mdash;and forego all chance
of happiness. Like a silly girl. A fool girl
who says, 'I will never marry!' just because
of some quarrel *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* But the girl never
keeps her word. A man must."</p>

<p>The days were long to Vivian now, and
dragged a little, for all her industry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. St. Cloud tried to revive their former
intimacy, but the girl could not renew it on
the same basis. She, too, had sympathized
with Mr. Dykeman, and now sympathized
somewhat with Mr. Skee. But since that
worthy man still volubly discoursed on Platonism,
and his fair friend openly agreed
in this view, there seemed no real ground for
distress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew remained ailing and
rather captious. She had a telephone put
at her bedside, and ran her household affairs
efficiently, with Vivian as lieutenant, and the
ever-faithful Jeanne to uphold the honor of
the cuisine. Also she could consult her
physician, and demanded his presence at all
hours.</p>

<p>He openly ignored Mrs. St. Cloud now,
who met his rude treatment with secret, uncomplaining
patience.</p>

<p>Vivian spoke of this. "I do not see why
he need be so rude, Grandma. He may hate
women, but I don't see why he should treat
her so shamefully."</p>

<p>"Well, I do," replied the invalid, "and
what's more I'm going to show you; I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
always disliked that woman, and now I
know why. I'd turn her out of the house
if it wasn't for Elmer Skee. That man's as
good as gold under all his foolishness, and
if he can get any satisfaction out of that
meringue he's welcome. Dr. Hale doesn't
hate women, child, but a woman broke his
heart once&mdash;and then he made an idiot of
himself by vowing never to marry."</p>

<p>She showed her friend's letter, and Vivian
read it with rising color. "O, Grandma!
Why that's worse than I ever thought&mdash;even
after what Dr. Bellair told us. And it was
his brother! No wonder he's so fond of
boys. He tries to warn them, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the worst of it is that he's really
got over his grouch; and he's in love&mdash;but
tied down by that foolish oath, poor man."</p>

<p>"Is he, Grandma? How do you know?
With whom?"</p>

<p>"You dear, blind child!" said the old lady,
"with you, of course. Has been ever since
we came."</p>

<p>The girl sat silent, a strange feeling of joy
rising in her heart, as she reviewed the
events of the last two years. So that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
why he would not stay that night. And that
was why. "No wonder he wouldn't come
here!" she said at length. "It's on account
of that woman. But why did he change?"</p>

<p>"Because she went over there to see him.
He wouldn't come to her. I heard her
'phone to him one evening." The old lady
chuckled. "So she marched herself over
there&mdash;I saw her, and I guess she got her
needin's. She didn't stay long. And his
light burned till morning."</p>

<p>"Do you think he cares for her, still?"</p>

<p>"Cares for her!" The old lady fairly
snorted her derision. "He can't bear the
sight of her&mdash;treats her as if she wasn't
there. No, indeed. If he did she'd have
him fast enough, now. Well! I suppose
he'll repent of that foolishness of his all the
days of his life&mdash;and stick it out! Poor
man."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew sighed, and Vivian echoed
the sigh. She began to observe Dr. Hale with
new eyes; to study little matters of tone and
manner&mdash;and could not deny her grandmother's
statement. Nor would she admit
it&mdash;yet.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>The old lady seemed weaker and more
irritable, but positively forbade any word of
this being sent to her family.</p>

<p>"There's nothing on earth ails me," she
said. "Dr. Hale says there's not a thing the
matter that he can see&mdash;that if I'd only eat
more I'd get stronger. I'll be all right soon,
my dear. I'll get my appetite and get well,
I have faith to believe."</p>

<p>She insisted on his coming over in the
evening, when not too busy, and staying till
she dropped asleep, and he seemed strangely
willing to humor her; sitting for hours in
the quiet parlor, while Vivian played softly,
and sang her low-toned hymns.</p>

<p>So sitting, one still evening, when for
some time no fretful "not so loud" had come
from the next room, he turned suddenly to
Vivian and asked, almost roughly&mdash;"Do
you hold a promise binding?&mdash;an oath, a
vow&mdash;to oneself?"</p>

<p>She met his eyes, saw the deep pain there,
the long combat, the irrepressible hope and
longing.</p>

<p>"Did you swear to keep your oath secret?"
she asked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, no," he said, "I did not. I will tell
you. I did not swear never to tell a woman
I loved her. I never dreamed I should love
again. Vivian, I was fool enough to love a
shallow, cruel woman, once, and nearly
broke my heart in consequence. That was
long years ago. I have never cared for a
woman since&mdash;till I met you. And now I
must pay double for that boy folly."</p>

<p>He came to her and took her hand.</p>

<p>"I love you," he said, his tense grip hurting
her. "I shall love you as long as I
live&mdash;day and night&mdash;forever! You shall
know that at any rate!"</p>

<p>She could not raise her eyes. A rich
bright color rose to the soft border of her
hair. He caught her face in his hands and
made her look at him; saw those dark, brilliant
eyes softened, tear-filled, asking, and
turned sharply away with a muffled cry.</p>

<p>"I have taken a solemn oath," he said in
a strained, hard voice, "never to ask a
woman to marry me."</p>

<p>He heard a little gasping laugh, and
turned upon her. She stood there smiling,
her hands reached out to him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't have to," she said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A long time later, upon their happy stillness
broke a faint voice from the other room:</p>

<p>"Vivian, I think if you'd bring me some
bread and butter&mdash;and a cup of tea&mdash;and
some cold beef and a piece of pie&mdash;I could
eat it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon the rapid and complete recovery of
her grandmother's health, and the announcement
of Vivian's engagement, Mr. and Mrs.
Lane decided to make a visit to their distant
mother and daughter, hoping as well that
Mr. Lane's cough might be better for a visit
in that altitude. Mr. and Mrs. Dykeman
also sent word of their immediate return.</p>

<p>Jeanne, using subtle powers of suggestion,
caused Mrs. Pettigrew to decide upon
giving a dinner, in honor of these events.
There was the betrothed couple, there were
the honored guests; there were Jimmie and
Susie, with or without the baby; there were
the Dykemans; there was Dr. Bellair, of
course; there was Mr. Skee, an even number.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to spoil that table, but I've got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
to take in Mrs. St. Cloud," said the old lady.</p>

<p>"O, Grandma! Why! It'll spoil it for
Dick."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said her grandmother. "He's so
happy you couldn't spoil it with a mummy.
If I don't ask her it'll spoil it for Mr. Skee."</p>

<p>So Mrs. St. Cloud made an eleventh at the
feast, and neither Mr. Dykeman nor Vivian
could find it in their happy hearts to care.</p>

<p>Mr. Skee arose, looking unusually tall
and shapely in immaculate every-day dress,
his well-brushed hair curling vigorously
around the little bald spots; his smile wide
and benevolent.</p>

<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, both Domestic
and Foreign, Friends and Fellowtownsmen
and Women&mdash;Ladies, God Bless 'em; also
Children, if any: I feel friendly enough to-night
to include the beasts of the fields&mdash;but
such would be inappropriate at this convivial
board&mdash;among these convivial boarders.</p>

<p>"This is an occasion of great rejoicing.
We have many things to rejoice over,
both great <i>and</i> small. We have our healths;
all of us, apparently. We are experiencing
the joys of reunion&mdash;in the matter of visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>ing
parents that is, and long absent
daughters.</p>

<p>"We have also the Return of the Native,
in the shape of my old friend Andy&mdash;now
become a Benedict&mdash;and seeming to enjoy
it. About this same Andy I have a piece of
news to give you which will cause you
astonishment and gratification, but which
involves me in a profuse apology&mdash;a most
sincere and general apology.</p>

<p>"You know how a year or more ago it was
put about in this town that Andrew Dykeman
was a ruined man?" Mrs. St. Cloud
darted a swift glance at Mr. Dykeman, but
his eyes rested calmly on his wife; then at
Mr. Skee&mdash;but he was pursuing his remorseful
way.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to blame my friend Andy
for his reticence&mdash;but he certainly did exhibit
reticence on this occasion&mdash;to beat the
band! He never contradicted this rumor&mdash;not
once. <i>He</i> just went about looking kind
o' down in the mouth for some reason or
other, and when for the sake o' Auld Lang
Syne I offered him a job in my office&mdash;the
cuss took it! I won't call this de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>ceitful,
but it sure was reticent to a degree.</p>

<p>"Well, Ladies&mdash;and Gentlemen&mdash;the best
of us are liable to mistakes, and I have to
admit&mdash;I am glad to humble myself and
make this public admission&mdash;I was entirely
in error in this matter.</p>

<p>"It wasn't so. There was nothing in it.
It was rumor, pure and simple. Andy
Dykeman never lost no mine, it appears; or
else he had another up his sleeve concealed
from his best friends. Anyhow, the facts
are these; not only that A. Dykeman as he
sits before you is a prosperous and wealthy
citizen, but that he has been, for these ten
years back, and we were all misled by a mixture
of rumor and reticence. If he has concealed
these facts from the wife of his bosom
I submit that that is carrying reticence too
far!" Again Mrs. St. Cloud sent a swift
glance at the reticent one, and again caught
only his tender apologetic look toward his
wife, and her utter amazement.</p>

<p>Mr. Dykeman rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I make no apologies for interrupting my
friend," he said. "It is necessary at times.
He at least can never be accused of reticence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Neither do I make apologies for letting
rumor take its course&mdash;a course often interesting
to observe. But I do apologize&mdash;in
this heartfelt and public manner, to my wife,
for marrying her under false pretenses. But
any of you gentlemen who have ever had any
experience in the attitude of," he hesitated
mercifully, and said, "the World, toward a
man with money, may understand what it
meant to me, after many years of bachelorhood,
to find a heart that not only loved me
for myself alone, but absolutely loved me
better because I'd lost my money&mdash;or she
thought I had. I have hated to break the
charm. But now my unreticent friend here
has stated the facts, and I make my confession.
Will you forgive me, Orella?"</p>

<p>"Speech! Speech!" cried Mr. Skee. But
Mrs. Dykeman could not be persuaded to do
anything but blush and smile and squeeze
her husband's hand under the table, and Mr.
Skee arose once more.</p>

<p>"This revelation being accomplished," he
continued cheerfully; "and no one any the
worse for it, as I see," he was not looking
in the direction of Mrs. St. Cloud, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
slippered foot beat softly under the table,
though her face wore its usual sweet expression,
possibly a trifle strained; "I now proceed
to a proclamation of that happy event
to celebrate which we are here gathered together.
I allude to the Betrothal of Our
Esteemed Friend, Dr. Richard Hale, and
the Fairest of the Fair! Regarding the
Fair, we think he has chosen well. But regarding
Dick Hale, his good fortune is so
clear, so evidently undeserved, and his pride
and enjoyment thereof so ostentatious,
as to leave us some leeway to make remarks.</p>

<p>"Natural remarks, irresistible remarks, as
you might say, and not intended to be
acrimonious. Namely, such as these: It's a
long lane that has no turning; There's many
a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip; The worm
will turn; The pitcher that goes too often to
the well gets broken at last; Better Late
than Never. And so on and so forth. Any
other gentleman like to make remarks on
this topic?"</p>

<p>Dr. Hale rose, towering to his feet.</p>

<p>"I think I'd better make them," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
"No one else could so fully, so heartily, with
such perfect knowledge point out how many
kinds of a fool I've been for all these years.
And yet of them all there are only two that
I regret&mdash;this last two in which if I had been
wiser, perhaps I might have found my happiness
sooner. As that cannot be proven,
however, I will content myself with the general
acknowledgment that Bachelors are
Misguided Bats, I myself having long been
the worst instance; women, in general, are
to be loved and honored; and that I am
proud and glad to accept your congratulations
because the sweetest and noblest
woman in the world has honored me with
her love."</p>

<p>"I never dreamed you could put so many
words together, Doc&mdash;and really make
sense!" said Mr. Skee, genially, as he rose
once more. "You certainly show a proper
spirit at last, and all is forgiven. But now,
my friends; now if your attention is not exhausted,
I have yet another Event to confide
to you."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Lane wore an aspect of
polite interest. Susie and Jim looked at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
other with a sad but resigned expression.
So did Mrs. Dykeman and her husband.
Vivian's hand was in her lover's and she
could not look unhappy, but they, too, deprecated
this last announcement, only too
well anticipated. Only Mrs. St. Cloud, her
fair face bowed in gentle confusion, showed
anticipating pleasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Skee waved his hand toward her with
a large and graceful gesture.</p>

<p>"You must all of you have noticed the
amount of Platonic Friendship which has
been going on for some time between my
undeserving self and this lovely lady here.
Among so many lovely ladies perhaps I'd
better specify that I refer to the one on my
left.</p>

<p>"What she has been to me, in my lonely
old age, none of you perhaps realize."
He wore an expression as of one long
exiled, knowing no one who could speak his
language.</p>

<p>"She has been my guide, counsellor and
friend; she has assisted me with advice most
wise and judicious; she has not interfered
with my habits, but has allowed me to en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>joy
life in my own way, with the added attraction
of her companionship.</p>

<p>"Now, I dare say, there may have been
some of you who have questioned my assertion
that this friendship was purely Platonic.
Perhaps even the lady herself, knowing the
heart of man, may have doubted if my feeling
toward her was really friendship."</p>

<p>Mr. Skee turned his head a little to one
side and regarded her with a tender inquiring
smile.</p>

<p>To this she responded sweetly: "Why no,
Mr. Skee, of course, I believed what you
said."</p>

<p>"There, now," said he, admiringly.
"What is so noble as the soul of woman? It
is to this noble soul in particular, and to all
my friends here in general, that I now confide
the crowning glory of a long and checkered
career, namely, and to wit, that I am
engaged to be married to that Peerless
Lady, Mrs. Servilla Pettigrew, of whose remarkable
capacities and achievements I can
never sufficiently express my admiration."</p>

<p>A silence fell upon the table. Mr. Skee
sat down smiling, evidently in cheerful ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>pectation
of congratulations. Mrs. Pettigrew
wore an alert expression, as of a skilled
fencer preparing to turn any offered thrusts.
Mrs. St. Cloud seemed to be struggling with
some emotion, which shook her usual sweet
serenity. The others, too, were visibly
affected, and not quick to respond.</p>

<p>Then did Mr. Saunders arise with real
good nature and ever-ready wit; and pour
forth good-humored nonsense with congratulations
all around, till a pleasant atmosphere
was established, in which Mrs. St.
Cloud could so far recover as to say many
proper and pretty things; sadly adding
that she regretted her imminent return to
the East would end so many pleasant
friendships.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
